    "definition": "An inhibitor of induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein MCL-1 (myeloid cell leukemia-1), with potential pro-apoptotic and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, tapotoclax binds to and inhibits the activity of MCL-1. This disrupts the formation of MCL-1/Bcl-2-like protein 11 (BCL2L11; BIM) complexes and induces apoptosis in tumor cells. MCL-1, an anti-apoptotic protein belonging to the Bcl-2 family of proteins, is upregulated in cancer cells and promotes tumor cell survival.",
