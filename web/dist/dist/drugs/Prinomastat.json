    "definition": "A synthetic hydroxamic acid derivative with potential antineoplastic activity.  Prinomastat inhibits matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (specifically, MMP-2, 9, 13, and 14), thereby inducing extracellular matrix degradation, and inhibiting angiogenesis, tumor growth and invasion, and metastasis.  As a lipophilic agent, prinomastat crosses the blood-brain barrier.",
