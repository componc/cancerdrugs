This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s). Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) ( 1.2 ). Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) with 17p deletion ( 1.3 ). Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulinemia (WM) ( 1.4 ). Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who require systemic therapy and have received at least one prior anti-CD20-based therapy ( 1.5 ). This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s). Chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy ( 1.6 ). 1.1 Mantle Cell Lymphoma IMBRUVICA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy.

    "definition": "An orally bioavailable, small-molecule inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, ibrutinib binds to and irreversibly inhibits BTK activity, thereby preventing both B-cell activation and B-cell-mediated signaling. This leads to an inhibition of the growth of malignant B cells that overexpress BTK. BTK, a member of the src-related BTK/Tec family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, is required for B cell receptor signaling, plays a key role in B-cell maturation, and is overexpressed in a number of B-cell malignancies. The expression of BTK in tumor cells is also associated with increased proliferation and survival.",
