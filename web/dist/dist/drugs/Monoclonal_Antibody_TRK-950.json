    "definition": "A proprietary monoclonal antibody targeting an as of yet undisclosed tumor-associated antigen (TAA), with potential antineoplastic activity. Although the mechanism of action has not been elucidated presumably monoclonal antibody TRK-950 binds to a specific TAA on the cell surface of tumor cells and may induce complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). This may lead to the death of tumor cells expressing the TAA.",
