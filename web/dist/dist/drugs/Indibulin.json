Indibulin binds to a site on tubulin that is different from taxane- or Vinca alkaloid-binding sites, destabilizing tubulin polymerization and inducing tumor cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. This agent has been shown to be active against multidrug-resistant (MDR) and taxane- resistant tumor cell lines.",
