    "definition": "A fully human combinatorial antibody library (HuCAL)-derived monoclonal antibody targeting the B-cell-activating factor receptor (BAFF-R), with potential anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, ianalumab targets and binds to BAFF-R, which inhibits both BAFF/BAFF-R interaction and BAFF-R-mediated signaling. This may decrease cell growth in tumor cells expressing BAFF-R. BAFF-R, also known as tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 13C, is overexpressed in certain tumor cell types and autoimmune diseases. In cancer cells, BAFF-R plays a key role in B-cell proliferation and survival. VAY736 was developed using HuCAL technology.",
