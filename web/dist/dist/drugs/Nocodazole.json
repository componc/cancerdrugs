    "definition": "A synthetic tubulin-binding agent with antineoplastic activity. Nocodazole binds to beta-tubulin and disrupts microtubule assembly/disassembly dynamics. This prevents mitosis and induces apoptosis in tumor cells. Although nocodazole binding site overlaps with that of colchicine, the two agents are structurally quite different.",
