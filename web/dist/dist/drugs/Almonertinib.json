    "definition": "An orally available inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant form T790M, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, almonertinib binds to and inhibits EGFR T790M, a secondarily acquired resistance mutation, inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR T790M, prevents EGFR T790M-mediated signaling and leads to cell death in EGFR T790M-expressing tumor cells. EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is mutated in many tumor cell types, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization.",
