    "definition": "A non-metabolizable glucose analog in which the hydroxyl group at position 2 of glucose is replaced by hydrogen, with potential glycolysis inhibiting and antineoplastic activities. Although the exact mechanism of action has yet to be fully elucidated, upon administration of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), this agent competes with glucose for uptake by proliferating cells, such as tumor cells. 2-DG inhibits the first step of glycolysis and therefore prevents cellular energy production, which may result in decreased tumor cell proliferation.",
