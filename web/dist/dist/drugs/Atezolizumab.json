Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for NSCLC harboring these aberrations prior to receiving TECENTRIQ. ( 1.2 ) Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) in combination with paclitaxel protein-bound for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC whose tumors express PD-L1 (PD-L1 stained tumor-infiltrating immune cells [IC] of any intensity covering \u2265 1% of the tumor area), as determined by an FDA approved test. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on progression free survival. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s). ( 1.3 ) Limitations of Use : TECENTRIQ is not indicated for use in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC ( 1.3 , 5.4 , 14.4 ). Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) in combination with carboplatin and etoposide, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). ( 1.4 ) Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) in combination with bevacizumab for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic HCC who have not received prior systemic therapy ( 1.5 ) Melanoma in combination with cobimetinib and vemurafenib for the treatment of patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma.

Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s). 1.2 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer TECENTRIQ, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression (PD-L1 stained \u2265 50% of tumor cells [TC \u2265 50%] or PD-L1 stained tumor-infiltrating immune cells [IC] covering \u2265 10% of the tumor area [IC \u2265 10%]), as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. TECENTRIQ, in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. TECENTRIQ, in combination with paclitaxel protein-bound and carboplatin, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. TECENTRIQ, as a single-agent, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for NSCLC harboring these aberrations prior to receiving TECENTRIQ. 1.3 Locally Advanced or Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer TECENTRIQ, in combination with paclitaxel protein-bound, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) whose tumors express PD-L1 (PD-L1 stained tumor-infiltrating immune cells [IC] of any intensity covering \u2265 1% of the tumor area), as determined by an FDA-approved test [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on progression free survival [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s). Limitations of Use TECENTRIQ is not indicated for use in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Studies (14.4) ]. 1.4 Small Cell Lung Cancer TECENTRIQ, in combination with carboplatin and etoposide, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). 1.5 Hepatocellular Carcinoma TECENTRIQ, in combination with bevacizumab, is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have not received prior systemic therapy. 1.6 Melanoma TECENTRIQ, in combination with cobimetinib and vemurafenib, is indicated for the treatment of patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] .",

    "definition": "A humanized, Fc optimized, monoclonal antibody directed against the protein ligand PD-L1 (programmed cell death-1 ligand 1), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Atezolizumab binds to PD-L1, blocking its binding to and activation of its receptor programmed death 1 (PD-1) expressed on activated T-cells, which may enhance the T-cell-mediated immune response to neoplasms and reverse T-cell inactivation. In addition, by binding to PD-L1, MPDL3280A also prevents binding of this ligand to B7.1 expressed on activated T cells, which further enhances the T-cell-mediated immune response. PD-L1 is overexpressed on many human cancer cell types and on various tumor-infiltrating immune cells. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in increased immune evasion. PD-1, a transmembrane protein, is a negative regulator of the immune system that limits the expansion and survival of CD8+ T cells. The Fc region of MPDL3280A is modified in such a way that it does not induce either antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).",
