    "definition": "An antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a proprietary monoclonal antibody against the prolactin receptor (PRLR) linked to an as of yet undisclosed cytotoxic agent, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon intravenous administration of rolinsatamab talirine, rolinsatamab targets and binds to PRLR expressed on tumor cells. Upon binding and internalization, talirine is released and kills the PRLR-expressing tumor cells, through an as of yet unknown mechanism of action. PRLR, a tumor-associated antigen (TAA), is overexpressed by a variety of tumor cell types.",
