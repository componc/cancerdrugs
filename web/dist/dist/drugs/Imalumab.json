    "definition": "A human, recombinant monoclonal antibody (MoAb) against macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), with potential immunomodulating, anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic activities. Upon intravenous administration, imalumab binds to MIF, blocking its activity and preventing the MIF-mediated secretion of certain cytokines, including interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. This may lead to an inhibition of cancer cell proliferation in MIF-overexpressing tumor cells. MIF, a pro-inflammatory cytokine overexpressed in some cancers, plays a key role in inflammation, immune responses and cancer cell proliferation.",
