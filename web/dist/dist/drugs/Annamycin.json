Annamycin intercalates into DNA and inhibits topoisomerase II, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and repair as well as inhibiting RNA and protein synthesis.  This agent appears to not be a substrate for the p-glycoprotein associated multidrug-resistance (MDR) transporter; therefore, overcoming the resistance pattern seen with other anthracycline compounds.",
