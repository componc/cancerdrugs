    "definition": "A genetically-engineered, chimeric mouse-human, anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody with potential antineoplastic activity. Brentuximab specifically binds to the receptor CD-30, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor super-family, which may be overexpressed on the surfaces of Hodgkin lymphoma cells and anaplastic-large cell lymphoma cells. After binding to CD30, this agent interferes with the G1 phase of the cell cycle, thereby inducing growth arrest and apoptosis in susceptible tumor cell populations.",
