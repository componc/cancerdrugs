    "definition": "A chimeric monoclonal antibody directed against the antigen GC182 with potential immunostimulatory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, zolbetuximab specifically binds to GC128, which may stimulate the immune system to mount a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against GC182-expressing tumor cells, resulting in decreased tumor cell proliferation. The CD20-like antigen GC182, a gastric differentiation protein, is often overexpressed on the cell surfaces of a variety of tumor cells, including gastric, pancreatic, esophageal cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells.",
