    "definition": "An IgG1k fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the human prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) with potential antineoplastic activity. Anti-PSCA fully human monoclonal antibody MK4721 selectively targets and binds to PSCA, triggering complement-dependent cell lysis and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in tumor cells expressing PSCA. PSCA is a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked cell surface antigen found in cancers of the bladder, pancreas, and prostate.",
