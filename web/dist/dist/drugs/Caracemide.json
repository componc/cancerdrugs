    "definition": "An agent derived from acetohydroxamic acid with potential antineoplastic activity.  Caracemide inhibits ribonuclease reductase, resulting in decreased DNA synthesis and tumor growth; it also inhibits acetylcholinesterase.  In vivo, caracemide contributes to the formation of the neurotoxin methyl isocyanate; this effect, along with the agent's acetylcholinesterase activity, may be responsible for the severe central nervous system toxicity observed in clinical trials.",
