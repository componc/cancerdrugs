    "definition": "A human, non-agonistic immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody directed against the cell surface glycoprotein ADP-ribosyl cyclase 1 (CD38) with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Mezagitamab specifically binds to CD38 that is expressed on human plasmablasts, plasma cells, NK cells and activated T- and B-cells. This may trigger antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), cell lysis and depletion of CD38-expressing cells. Additionally, TAK-079 does not induce CD38-dependent signaling and does not promote cytokine activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs). CD38, a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, is overexpressed on cells associated with autoimmune diseases and hematologic malignancies.",
