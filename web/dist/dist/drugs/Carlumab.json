    "definition": "A human IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody directed against human CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) with potential antineoplastic activity. Carlumab binds to and inhibits CLL2, which may result in inhibition of angiogenesis and, so, tumor cell proliferation. Endothelium-derived CLL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein; MCP1) is a member of the beta-chemokine family, can stimulate monocyte/macrophage migration and smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, and plays a role in angiogenesis and tumor cell migration; CCL2 induction of angiogenesis may involve the upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) gene expression which, in turn, induces vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) gene expression.",
