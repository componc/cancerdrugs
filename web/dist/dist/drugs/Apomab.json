    "definition": "A fully human monoclonal antibody directed against human death receptor 5 (DR5; TRAIL-R2; TNFRSF10B) with potential pro-apoptotic and antineoplastic activities. Mimicking the natural ligand TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand), apomab binds to DR5, which may directly activate the extrinsic apoptosis pathway and indirectly induce the intrinsic apoptosis pathway in tumor cells. DR5 is a cell surface receptor of the TNF-receptor superfamily and is expressed in a broad range of cancers.",
