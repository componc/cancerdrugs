    "definition": "An agonistic antibody that recognizes the co-stimulatory receptor OX40 (CD134; TNFRSF4), with potential immunostimulatory activity. Upon administration, ivuxolimab selectively binds to and activates OX40; which induces proliferation of memory and effector T-lymphocytes. In the presence of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), this may promote a T-cell-mediated immune response against TAA-expressing tumor cells. OX40, a cell surface glycoprotein and member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF), is expressed on T-lymphocytes and plays an essential role in T-cell activation.",
