    "definition": "A humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis receptor (TWEAKR) with potential antineoplastic, immunomodulating and antiangiogenic activities. Enavatuzumab binds to TWEAKR and inhibits TWEAK ligand binding and activation of NF-kappaB-mediated cytokine release, which may result in tumor cell apoptosis. TWEAKR is a cell-surface receptor with homology to tumor necrosis factor receptors. Upon binding with its ligand, TWEAKR has been shown to stimulate cytokine release and cell proliferation, migration, and survival; it may also promote apoptosis under some conditions. This receptor may be overexpressed in a variety of tumors including those of the pancreas, colon, lung, kidney, and breast.",
