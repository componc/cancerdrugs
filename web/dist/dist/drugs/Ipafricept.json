    "definition": "A proprietary fusion protein comprised of the cysteine-rich domain of frizzled family receptor 8 (Fzd8) fused to the human immunoglobulin Fc domain with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon intravenous administration, ipafricept competes with the membrane-bound Fzd8 receptor for its ligand, Wnt proteins, thereby antagonizing Wnt signaling. This may result in the inhibition of Wnt-driven tumor growth. Fzd8, a member of the Frizzled family of G protein-coupled receptors, is one of the components in the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway that plays key roles in embryogenesis and cancer growth.",
