    "definition": "An orally available, small-molecule, irreversible inhibitor of lysyl oxidase homolog 2 (lysyl oxidase-like protein 2; LOXL2) with potential antifibrotic activity. Upon oral administration, the aminomethyl pyridine moiety of LOXL2 inhibitor GB2064 interacts with the active site of LOXL2 to form a pseudo-irreversible inhibitory complex, thereby inhibiting the catalytic activity of LOXL2. LOXL2, a secreted glycoprotein, catalyzes the post-translational oxidative deamination of lysine residues on target proteins, including collagen and elastin, leading to the formation of deaminated lysine (allysine). Condensation with other allysines or lysines drives the formation of inter- and intramolecular cross-linkages that impact remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM), potentially leading to fibrosis. Inhibition of LOXL2, which is often upregulated in fibrotic tissue, may reduce fibrosis in certain chronic fibrotic diseases.",
