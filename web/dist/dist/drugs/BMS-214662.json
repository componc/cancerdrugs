    "definition": "A nonsedating benzodiazepine derivative with potential antineoplastic activity. Farnesyltransferase inhibitor BMS-214662 inhibits the enzyme farnesyltransferase and the post-translational farnesylation of number of proteins involved in signal transduction, which may result in the inhibition of Ras function and apoptosis in susceptible tumor cells. This agent may reverse the malignant phenotype of H-Ras-transformed cells and has been shown to be active against tumor cells with and without Ras mutations.",
