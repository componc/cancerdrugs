    "definition": "A recombinant human soluble protein corresponding to amino acids 114-281 of the Apo2 ligand/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (RhApo2L/TRAIL) with potential antineoplastic activity. Dulanermin binds to and activates TRAIL receptors 1 and 2 (TRAIL-R1/R2), which may activate caspases and induce p53-independent apoptosis in TRAIL-R1/R2-expressing tumor cells. The pro-apoptotic cell surface receptors TRAIL-R1 and -R2, also known as DR4 (death receptor 4) and DR5 (death receptor 5), are members of the TNF receptor family and are overexpressed by a variety of cancer cell types.",
