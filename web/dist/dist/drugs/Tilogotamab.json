    "definition": "An agonistic hexamer formation-enhanced mixture of two antibodies (HexaBody) that target two separate epitopes on death receptor type 5 (DR5; TNFRSF10B; tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 2; TRAILR2), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, tilogotamab specifically binds to and activates DR5. This results in the activation of caspase cascades and the induction of apoptosis in DR5-expressing tumor cells. DR5, a cell surface receptor and member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF), is involved in the promotion of caspase-dependent apoptosis. Compared to other DR5 antibody-based agonists, the antibodies in GEN1029 (DR5-01 and DR5-05) elicit increased receptor activation because they exhibit enhanced formation of antibody hexamers and receptor clusters at the cell surface due to E430G mutations in the Fc domains of both antibodies.",
