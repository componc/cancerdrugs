Upon administration, naporafenib binds to Raf proteins and inhibits Raf-mediated signal transduction pathways. This inhibits proliferation of Raf-overexpressing tumor cells. Raf protein kinases are critical enzymes in the Ras\u002FRaf\u002FMEK\u002FERK signaling pathway and are upregulated in a variety of cancer cell types.
