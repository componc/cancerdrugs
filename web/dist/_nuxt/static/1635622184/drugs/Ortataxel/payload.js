Ortataxel binds to and stabilizes tubulin molecules, thereby interfering with the dynamics of microtubule assembly\u002Fdisassembly. This results in the inhibition of cell division and cellular proliferation. As it represents a poor substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multi-drug resistance protein (MRP-1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) mediated efflux, ortataxel modulates multi-drug resistance mechanisms and may be useful for treating multi-drug resistant tumors that express Pgp, MRP-1 and BCRP.",fdaUniiCode:"8H61Y4E29N",identifier:"C1867",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C1490","C67437"],synonyms:["(3aS,4R,5E,7R,8aS,9S,10aR,12aS,12bR,13S,13aS)-7,12a-Bis(acetyloxy)-13-(benzoyloxy)-9-hydroxy-5,8a,14,14-tetramethyl-2,8-dioxo-3a,4,7,8,8a,9,10,10a,12,12a,12b,13-dodecahydro-6,13a-methano-13aH-oxeto(2',3':5',6')benzo(1',2':4,5)cyclodeca(1,2-d)-1,3-dioxol-4-yl(2R,3S)-3-(((1,1-dimethylethoxy)carbonyl)amino)-2-hydroxy-5-methylhexanoate","BAY 59-8862","BAY59-8862","Bay 59-8862","IDN5109","ORTATAXEL",a,"SB-T-101131"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FOrtataxel",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Ortataxel","","2021-10-30T13:36:58.783Z")));
