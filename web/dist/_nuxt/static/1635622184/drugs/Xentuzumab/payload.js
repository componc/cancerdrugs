Upon administration, xentuzumab binds to both IGF-1 and IGF-2 and inhibits the binding of these ligands to their receptor, IGF-1R. This blocks the insulin growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway, which is upregulated in a number of cancer cell types and plays a key role in cancer cell proliferation and chemoresistance. In addition, BI 836845 prevents the binding of IGF-2 to insulin receptor variant A (IR-A), preventing its activation.",fdaUniiCode:"X86Z1O656G",identifier:"C106118",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Immunologic Factor",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:["BI 836845","Immunoglobulin G1, Anti-(Human Insulin-like Growth Factor I) (Human Monoclonal PS05388 Heavy Chain), Disulfide with Human Monoclonal PS05388 Light Chain, Dimer","XENTUZUMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FXentuzumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Xentuzumab","","2021-10-30T13:17:52.363Z")));
