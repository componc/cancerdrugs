Ocaratuzumab specifically binds to CD20 antigen (B1), preventing mitogen-induced B-cell proliferation; inhibiting B-cell differentiation; and promoting antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and apoptosis of B cells expressing CD20. The Fc portion of this monoclonal antibody has been engineered to possess a higher binding affinity for variant Fc receptors on T helper cells, resulting in an augmentation of the anti-tumor immune response. Because of Fc engineering, this agent may be significantly more potent than rituximab in inducing B cell-directed ADCC. CD20 is a non-glycosylated cell surface phosphoprotein that is exclusively expressed on B cells during most stages of B cell development.",fdaUniiCode:"NTY9893GD0",identifier:"C2524",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:["AME-133v","Anti-CD20 Monoclonal Antibody AME-133v","LY 2469298","MoAb CD20","OCARATUZUMAB",a,"monoclonal antibody, CD20"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FOcaratuzumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Ocaratuzumab","","2021-10-30T13:37:45.243Z")));
