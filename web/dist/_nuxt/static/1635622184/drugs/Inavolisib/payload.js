PI3K inhibition prevents the activation of the PI3K-mediated signaling pathway and results in the inhibition of growth and survival of PI3K-overexpressing tumor cells. Dysregulation of the PI3K signaling pathway is frequently associated with tumorigenesis and tumor resistance to a variety of antineoplastic agents and radiotherapy. PIK3CA, which encodes the p110-alpha catalytic subunit of the class I PI3K, is frequently mutated in a variety of cancer cell types and plays a key role in cancer cell growth and invasion.",fdaUniiCode:"L4C1UY2NYH",identifier:"C132166",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C2152"],synonyms:["GDC 0077","GDC-0077","GDC0077","INAVOLISIB",a,"PI3K Inhibitor GDC0077","RG 6114","RG-6114","RG6114","RO 7113755"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FInavolisib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Inavolisib","","2021-10-30T13:31:32.613Z")));
