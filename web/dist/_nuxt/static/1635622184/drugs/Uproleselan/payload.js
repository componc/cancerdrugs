Upon administration, uproleselan binds to E-selectin expressed on endothelial cells and prevents their interaction with selectin-E ligand-expressing cancer cells. This may prevent tumor cell activation, migration and metastasis. GMI-1271 also interferes with the binding of selectin E-expressing vascular endothelial cells to selectin-E ligand-expressing monocytes and neutrophils, thereby disrupting their activation. Consequently, this inhibits both the activation of the coagulation cascade and thrombus formation. This agent also prevents both leukocyte activation and inflammation. E-selectin is a cell adhesion molecule involved in cell rolling, signaling and chemotaxis; it also plays a crucial role in inflammatory processes and cancer.",fdaUniiCode:"PE952ANF83",identifier:"C119743",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129824","C29750"],synonyms:["GMI-1271","UPROLESELAN",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FUproleselan",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Uproleselan","","2021-10-30T13:19:53.283Z")));
