Upon administration, senaparib selectively binds to PARP 1 and 2 and prevents PARP-mediated DNA repair of single-strand DNA breaks via the base-excision repair pathway. This enhances the accumulation of DNA strand breaks and promotes genomic instability and eventually leads to apoptosis. PARP catalyzes post-translational ADP-ribosylation of nuclear proteins that signal and recruit other proteins to repair damaged DNA and is activated by single-strand DNA breaks.",fdaUniiCode:"MNZ4OP95CF",identifier:"C168601",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C62554"],synonyms:["IMP 4297","IMP-4297","IMP4297","PARP 1\u002F2 Inhibitor IMP4297","SENAPARIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSenaparib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Senaparib","","2021-10-30T13:35:52.723Z")));
