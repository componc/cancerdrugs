Gataparsen hybridizes to survivin mRNA, thereby blocking translation of survivin protein, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family. Survivin, expressed during embryonal development, is upregulated in a variety of human cancers while absent in most normal adult cells; its expression in tumors is associated with a more aggressive phenotype, shorter survival times, and a decreased response to chemotherapy. Silencing expression of survivin potentially leads to restoration of the apoptotic process in cancer cells, thereby facilitating chemotherapeutic treatments.",fdaUniiCode:"3KY0EUQ36S",identifier:"C66935",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Nucleic Acid, Nucleoside, or Nucleotide",subclassOf:["C1291"],synonyms:["Antisurvivin Antisense Oligonucleotide LY2181308","GATAPARSEN SODIUM",c,"LY 2181308","LY-2181308","LY2181308","LY2181308 Heptadecasodium Salt"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FGataparsen_Sodium",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Gataparsen_Sodium","","Gataparsen Sodium","2021-10-30T13:43:00.343Z")));
