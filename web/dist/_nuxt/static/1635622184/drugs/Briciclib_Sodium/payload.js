Upon hydrolysis, briciclib is converted to ON 013100, which blocks cyclin D mRNA translation and decreases protein expression of cyclin D. This may induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells overexpressing cyclin D and eventually decrease tumor cell proliferation. This agent may exhibit synergistic antitumor activity in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Cyclin D, a member of the cyclin family of cell cycle regulators, plays a key role in cell cycle division and is often overexpressed in a variety of hematologic and solid tumors and is correlated with poor prognosis.",fdaUniiCode:"7C9N0VM8NR",identifier:"C90541",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C273"],synonyms:["2-Methoxy-5-(((2-(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)ethenyl)sulfonyl)methyl)phenyl Disodium Phosphate","BRICICLIB SODIUM",c,"ON 013105","Phenol, 2-Methoxy-5-((((1E)-2-(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)ethenyl)sulfonyl)methyl)-, 1-(Dihydrogen Phosphate), Sodium Salt (1:2)"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FBriciclib_Sodium",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Briciclib_Sodium","Briciclib Sodium","2021-10-30T13:47:06.083Z")));
