Upon administration of pacanalotamab, this bispecific antibody binds to both CD3 on cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) and BCMA found on BCMA-expressing tumor cells. This activates and redirects CTLs to BCMA-expressing tumor cells, which results in the CTL-mediated cell death of BCMA-expressing tumor cells. BCMA, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily that is specifically overexpressed on malignant plasma cells, plays a key role in promoting plasma cell survival.",fdaUniiCode:"102VUR9WQE",identifier:"C159652",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C181113"],synonyms:["AMG 420","AMG-420","AMG420","Anti-BCMA x Anti-CD3 BiTE AMG 420","Anti-BCMA\u002FCD3 BiTE Antibody AMG 420","BCMA\u002FCD3-directed Bispecific T-cell Engager Antibody AMG 420","BI 836909","BI-836909","BI836909","BiTE Antibody AMG 420","Bispecific T-cell Engager Antibody AMG 420","PACANALOTAMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FPacanalotamab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Pacanalotamab","","2021-10-30T13:34:56.313Z")));
