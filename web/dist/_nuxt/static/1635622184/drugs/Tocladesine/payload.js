Tocladesine appears to be converted to 8-chloro-adenosine by phosphodiesterases and subsequently phosphorylated to 8-chloro-ATP, which functions as a purine analogue and competes with ATP in transcription. In addition, generation of 8-chloro-ATP depletes endogenous ATP pool that is essential for many biological reactions in intracellular energy transfer. As a result, this agent causes RNA synthesis inhibition, blocks cellular proliferation, and induces apoptosis.",fdaUniiCode:"BQ94Z7E5OR",identifier:"C2571",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C1556","C1934"],synonyms:["8-Chloro Cyclic AMP","8-Chloroadenosine Cyclic 3':5'-Monophosphate","8-Cl-cAMP","Adenazole","TOCLADESINE",a,"tocladesine"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTocladesine",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Tocladesine","2021-10-30T13:37:49.463Z")));
