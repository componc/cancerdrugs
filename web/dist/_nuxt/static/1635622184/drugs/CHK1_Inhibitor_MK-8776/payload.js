Chk1 inhibitor MK-8776 specifically binds to and inhibits Chk1, which may result in tumor cells bypassing Chk1-dependent cell cycle arrest in the S and G2\u002FM phases to undergo DNA repair prior to entry into mitosis; tumor cells may thus be sensitized to the DNA-damaging effects of ionizing radiation and alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. Chk1 is an ATP-dependent serine-threonine kinase that in response to DNA damage phosphorylates cdc25 phosphatases, resulting in inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation of CDK-cyclin complexes and cell cycle arrest.",fdaUniiCode:"K2ZSF0992C",identifier:"C79867",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C155927"],synonyms:["(R)-6-Bromo-3-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-5-(piperidin-3-yl)pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-7-amine",c,"MK-8776","MK8776","SCH 900776","SCH-900776"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FCHK1_Inhibitor_MK-8776",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("CHK1_Inhibitor_MK-8776","","CHK1 Inhibitor MK-8776","2021-10-30T13:45:31.283Z")));
