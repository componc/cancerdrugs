Upon administration, the anti-BCMA antibody SEA-BCMA targets and binds to BCMA expressed on tumor cells.  When administered with antibody-coupled T-cell receptor (ACTR)-expressing T-cells, the ACTR-expressing T-cells bind, with high affinity, to the anti-BCMA antibody SEA-BCMA. This activates the ACTR T-cells and the T-cells induce specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated cytotoxicity toward BCMA-expressing tumor cells. BCMA, a cell surface protein and member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily that is specifically overexpressed on malignant plasma cells, plays a key role in promoting plasma cell survival.",fdaUniiCode:"3C28VJ95EV",identifier:"C148176",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C181113"],synonyms:["Anti-BCMA Afucosylated Monoclonal Antibody SEA-BCMA",c,"SEA-BCMA"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-BCMA_Antibody_SEA-BCMA",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-BCMA_Antibody_SEA-BCMA","Anti-BCMA Antibody SEA-BCMA","2021-10-30T13:33:10.083Z")));
