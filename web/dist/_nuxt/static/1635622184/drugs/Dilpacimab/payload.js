The target-binding variable domains of two monoclonal antibodies, which are not publicly known, are combined, via linkers, to create the tetravalent, dual-targeting single agent ABT-165. Upon administration of dual variable domain immunoglobulin (DVD-Ig) ABT-165, the target-binding variable domains specifically recognize and simultaneously bind to their two antigens expressed on tumor cells. This may both prevent antigen-mediated signaling and lead to an inhibition of cellular proliferation in susceptible tumor cells. The antigen targets are overexpressed on certain tumor cell types. The DVD-Ig may have enhanced physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties as compared to their antibody counterparts.",fdaUniiCode:"F27LAH6D5O",identifier:"C116750",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129820","C129821"],synonyms:["ABT-165","DILPACIMAB","DVD-Ig ABT-165",a,"Immunoglobulin, Anti-(Notch Ligand DLL4\u002FVascular Endothelial Growth Factor) (Synthetic Human PR-1283233 Heavy Chain), Disulfide with Synthetic Human PR-1283233 Light Chain, Dimer","PR-1283233","WHO 10863"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FDilpacimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Dilpacimab","","2021-10-30T13:19:16.203Z")));
