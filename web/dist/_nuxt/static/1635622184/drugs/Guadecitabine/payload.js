Following metabolic activation via cleavage of the phosphodiester bond and incorporation of the decitabine moiety into DNA, guadecitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase, thereby causing non-specific, genome-wide hypomethylation, and induction of cell cycle arrest at S-phase. This agent is resistant to cytidine deaminase, which may result in gradual release of decitabine both extra- and intra-cellularly, leading to prolonged exposure to decitabine.",fdaUniiCode:"2KT4YN1DP7",identifier:"C95209",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Nucleic Acid, Nucleoside, or Nucleotide",subclassOf:["C2083"],synonyms:["DNMT inhibitor SGI-110","GUADECITABINE",a,"S110","SGI-110"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FGuadecitabine",extension:".json",createdAt:"2021-10-30T13:47:54.533Z",updatedAt:"2021-10-30T13:47:54.543Z"}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Guadecitabine","")));
