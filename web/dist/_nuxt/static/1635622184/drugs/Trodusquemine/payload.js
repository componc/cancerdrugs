Upon administration, trodusquemine selectively targets and inhibits PTP1B, thereby preventing PTP1B-mediated signaling. This prevents the dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor, which improves insulin signaling and insulin sensitivity, and decreases blood glucose levels. In susceptible cancer cells, inhibition of PTP1B causes a reduction of tumor cell proliferation. In addition, as trodusquemine can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), it centrally suppresses appetite and causes weight loss. PTP1B, a tyrosine phosphatase, is elevated in certain cancer cells; it is specifically upregulated in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-driven cancers where it promotes cell growth, and is correlated with a poor prognosis and increased metastatic potential. In diabetes, PTP1B upregulation plays a major role in insulin resistance.",fdaUniiCode:"KKC12PIF16",identifier:"C123882",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C29728"],synonyms:["(24R)-3beta-((3-((4-((3-aminopropyl)amino)butyl)amino)propyl)amino)-7alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-cholestan-24-yl Hydrogen Sulfate","Cholestane-7,24-diol, 3-((3-((4-((3-aminopropyl)amino)butyl)amino)propyl)amino)-, 24-(Hydrogen Sulfate), (3beta,5alpha,7alpha,24R)-","MSI-1436","MSI-1436C","TRODUSQUEMINE",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTrodusquemine",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Trodusquemine","","2021-10-30T13:30:09.553Z")));
