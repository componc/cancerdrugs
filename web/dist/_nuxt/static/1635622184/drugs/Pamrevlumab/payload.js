Pamrevlumab binds to CTGF thereby preventing the binding of the ligand to the receptor and subsequent receptor activation. As CTGF enhances the production of collagen and fibronectin, FG-319 may prevent and reverse fibrosis. In addition, FG-3019 may prevent tumor cell proliferation in CTGF-expressing tumor cells. CTGF, a member of the CCN family (CTGF, CYR61\u002FCEF and NOV), is expressed in a variety of tumor cell types and is involved in processes such as cell proliferation, cell migration, cell adhesion, differentiation and angiogenesis.",fdaUniiCode:"QS5F6VTS0O",identifier:"C92577",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Immunologic Factor",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:["Anti-Connective Tissue Growth Factor Monoclonal Antibody FG-3019","FG-3019","FG3019","PAMREVLUMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FPamrevlumab",extension:".json",createdAt:"2021-10-30T13:47:38.383Z",updatedAt:"2021-10-30T13:47:38.393Z"}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Pamrevlumab","")));
