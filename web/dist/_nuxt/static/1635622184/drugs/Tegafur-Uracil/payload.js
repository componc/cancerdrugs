The high concentration of uracil reversibly inhibits the uracil-reducing enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), thereby inhibiting first-pass DPD-mediated hepatic metabolism of the uracil analogue 5-FU and permitting administration of 5-FU as the orally bioavailable prodrug tegafur. Tegafur is bioactivated to 5-FU by liver microsomal cytochrome P450 enzymes. 5-FU is subsequently converted into its active metabolites 5-fluoro-deoxyuridine-monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5-fluorouridine-triphosphate (FUTP) intracellularly; these metabolites inhibit the enzyme thymidylate synthase and intercalate into RNA, resulting in decreased thymidine synthesis, reduced DNA synthesis, disrupted RNA function, and tumor cell cytotoxicity.",fdaUniiCode:"HMI5GR78FR",identifier:"C9506",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Nucleic Acid, Nucleoside, or Nucleotide",subclassOf:["C2021"],synonyms:["Oral Fluorouracil-Uracil","TEGAFUR-URACIL",a,"UFT","Uftoral","Uracil and Ftorafur","Uracil and Tegafur","Uracil and Tetrahydrofuranyl-5-Fluorouracil","Uracil\u002FTegafur (UFT)","tegafur-uracil"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTegafur-Uracil",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Tegafur-Uracil","","2021-10-30T13:47:49.963Z")));
