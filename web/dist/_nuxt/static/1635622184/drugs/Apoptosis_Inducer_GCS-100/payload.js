Apoptosis inducer GCS-100 binds to the carbohydrate-binding domain of the lectin galectin-3, which may result in apoptosis mediated through mitochondria\u002Fcaspase activation cascades; this agent may overcome tumor growth mediated through anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, heat-shock protein 27 (Hsp27), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB). Galectin-3, a chimeric molecule consisting of both carbohydrate recognition and collagen-like domains, interacts with a variety of carbohydrate and protein ligands to form pentamers with unique crosslinking abilities; this lectin also exhibits anti-apoptotic properties, perhaps, in part, through the regulation of intracellular signaling pathways.",fdaUniiCode:"3HO3IZ2ILX",identifier:"C70984",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129839"],synonyms:[c,"GCS-100"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FApoptosis_Inducer_GCS-100",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Apoptosis_Inducer_GCS-100","Apoptosis Inducer GCS-100","2021-10-30T13:43:31.613Z")));
