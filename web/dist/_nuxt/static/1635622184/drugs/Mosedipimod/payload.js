Although the exact mechanism of action through which EC-18 exerts its pharmacological effect has yet to be fully identified, upon administration, mosedipimod stimulates calcium influx into T-lymphocytes and increases the production of various cytokines, including interleukin (IL) -2, IL-4, IL-12, interferon-gamma (IFN-g), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). This stimulates the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells, bone marrow stromal cells and immune cells, including T- and B-lymphocytes, dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. Therefore, EC18 may stimulate the immune system to target cancer cells. In addition, EC-18 enhances the cytolytic activity of natural killer (NK) cells and suppresses the expression of the transmembrane protein tumor cell toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) on cancer cells. As activation of TLR-4 enhances immunosuppression and stimulates cancer cell growth, blocking TLR-4 expression suppresses tumor cell proliferation.",fdaUniiCode:"88928BS57E",identifier:"C123775",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C308"],synonyms:["1-Palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-3-acetyl-rac-glycerol","9,12-Octadecadienoic acid (9Z,12Z)-, 1-((Acetyloxy)methyl)-2-((1-oxohexadecyl)oxy)ethyl Ester","EC-18","MOSEDIPIMOD",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FMosedipimod",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Mosedipimod","","2021-10-30T13:30:04.253Z")));
