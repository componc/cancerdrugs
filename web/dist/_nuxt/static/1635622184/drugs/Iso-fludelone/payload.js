Iso-fludelone binds to tubulin and induces microtubule polymerization and stabilizes microtubules against depolymerization, which may result in the inhibition of cell division, the induction of G2\u002FM arrest, and apoptosis. Compared to other generations of epothilones, iso-fludelone exhibits increased stability, water solubility, potency, duration of action, tumor penetration as well as reduced toxicity.
