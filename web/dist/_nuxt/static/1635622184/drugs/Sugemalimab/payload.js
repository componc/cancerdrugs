Upon administration, sugemalimab specifically targets and binds to PD-L1, blocking its binding to and activation of its receptor, programmed cell death 1 (PD-1). This reverses T-cell inactivation caused by PD-1\u002FPD-L1 signaling and enhances the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated anti-tumor immune response against PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. PD-L1 is overexpressed by many human cancer cell types. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion. PD-1, a transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed on activated T-cells, is a negative regulator of the immune system that limits the expansion and survival of CD8-positive T-cells. Anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody CS1001 mirrors natural immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4), potentially reducing immunogenicity and other toxicities.",fdaUniiCode:"90IQR2I6TR",identifier:"C154550",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C128057","C129822"],synonyms:["Anti-PD-L1 Monoclonal Antibody CS1001","Anti-PD-L1 Monoclonal Antibody WBP 3155","CS 1001","CS-1001","CS1001","SUGEMALIMAB",a,"WBP 315","WBP-315","WBP315"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSugemalimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Sugemalimab","","2021-10-30T13:34:10.203Z")));
