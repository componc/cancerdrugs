Racotumomab binds to the idiotype region of P3 MoAb and functionally mimics the three-dimensional structure of N-glycolyl ceramides of mono-sialyl lactose, the antigenic target of P3. As a result, this anti-idiotype antibody may stimulate the host immune system to elicit humoral and cellular immune responses against tumor cells expressing NeuGc-GM3 gangliosides, which are expressed in a wide variety of tumor cells.",fdaUniiCode:"52G405U1E5",identifier:"C95024",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Immunologic Factor",subclassOf:["C129822","C2590"],synonyms:["Anti-P3 Antibody Idiotype Monoclonal Antibody 1E10","MoAb 1E10","RACOTUMOMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FRacotumomab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Racotumomab","","2021-10-30T13:47:49.503Z")));
