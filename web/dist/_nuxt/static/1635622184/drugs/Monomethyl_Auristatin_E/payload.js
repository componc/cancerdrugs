Monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) binds to tubulin, blocks tubulin polymerization, and inhibits microtubule formation, which results in both disruption of mitotic spindle assembly and arrest of tumor cells in the M phase of the cell cycle. To minimize toxicity and maximize efficacy, MMAE is conjugated, via a cleavable peptide linker, to a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets a patient's tumor. The linker is stable in the extracellular milieu but is readily cleaved to release MMAE following binding and internalization of the ADC by the target cells.",fdaUniiCode:"V7I58RC5EJ",identifier:"C122637",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C67422"],synonyms:["(S)-N-((3R,4S,5S)-1-((S)-2-((1R,2R)-3-(((1S,2R)-1-hydroxy-1-phenylpropan-2-yl)amino)-1-methoxy-2-methyl-3-oxopropyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl)-3-methoxy-5-methyl-1-oxoheptan-4-yl)-N,3-dimethyl-2-((S)-3-methyl-2-(methylamino)butanamido)butanamide","L-Valinamide, N-methyl-L-valyl-N-((1S,2R)-4-((2S)-2-((1R,2R)-3-(((1R,2S)-2-hydroxy-1- methyl-2-phenylethyl)amino)-1-methoxy-2-methyl-3-oxopropyl)-1-pyrrolidinyl)-2- methoxy-1-((1S)-1-methylpropyl)-4-oxobutyl)-N-methyl-","MMAE","MONOMETHYL AURISTATIN E",c,"Monomethylauristatin E","N(sup 2)-(N-methyl-L-valyl)-N(sup 1)-((1S,2R)-4-((2S)-2-((1R,2R)-3-(((1R,2S)-2-hydroxy-1-methyl-2- phenylethyl)amino)-1-methoxy-2-methyl-3-oxopropyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl)-2-methoxy-1-((1S)-1-methylpropyl)-4-oxobutyl)-N(sup 1)-methyl-L-valinamide"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FMonomethyl_Auristatin_E",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Monomethyl_Auristatin_E","","Monomethyl Auristatin E","2021-10-30T13:29:56.913Z")));
