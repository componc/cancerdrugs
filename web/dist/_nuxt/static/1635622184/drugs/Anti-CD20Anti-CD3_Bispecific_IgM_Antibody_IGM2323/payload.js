Anti-CD20\u002FCD3 bispecific IgM antibody IGM2323 contains ten high affinity binding domains for the tumor-associated antigen (TAA) CD20, and one binding domain for CD3, a T-cell surface antigen. Upon administration, IGM2323 binds to both T-cells and CD20-expressing B-lineage tumor cells. The resulting cross-linkage may trigger a potent cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against the CD20-expressing tumor B-cells. Additionally, IGM-2323 induces complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) to a greater extent than anti-CD20\u002Fanti-CD3 IgG bispecific antibodies, thereby further enhancing the killing CD20-expressing tumor cells. The extra binding units of IGM-2323 may bind cancer cells that express relatively low amounts of CD20. Also, compared to IgG format bispecific T-cell engaging antibodies, IGM2323 appears to induce less cytokine release, which may reduce the risk of cytokine release syndrome (CRS). CD20 is exclusively expressed on B-cells during most stages of B-cell development and is often overexpressed in B-cell malignancies.",fdaUniiCode:"F3HG38I0T1",identifier:"C165166",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C141215","C28227"],synonyms:[c,"Bispecific CD20xCD3 IgM Antibody IGM2323","Bispecific IgM Antibody IGM2323","IGM 2323","IGM-2323","IGM2323","IgM Pentamer IGM2323"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-CD20Anti-CD3_Bispecific_IgM_Antibody_IGM2323",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-CD20Anti-CD3_Bispecific_IgM_Antibody_IGM2323","Anti-CD20\u002FAnti-CD3 Bispecific IgM Antibody IGM2323","2021-10-30T13:35:42.543Z")));
