PI3K-delta inhibitor AMG 319 prevents the activation of the PI3K signaling pathway through inhibition of the production of the second messenger phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), thus decreasing proliferation and inducing cell death.  Unlike other isoforms of PI3K, PI3K-delta is expressed primarily in hematopoietic lineages. The targeted inhibition of PI3K-delta is designed to preserve PI3K signaling in normal, non-neoplastic cells.",fdaUniiCode:"19DG7G1U5Q",identifier:"C95891",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C2152"],synonyms:["ACP-319","AMG 319","AMG-319","PI3K Inhibitor ACP-319",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FPI3K-delta_Inhibitor_AMG_319",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("PI3K-delta_Inhibitor_AMG_319","","PI3K-delta Inhibitor AMG 319","2021-10-30T13:48:15.573Z")));
