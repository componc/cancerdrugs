Upon administration, STAT3 inhibitor WP1066 blocks the intranuclear translocation of p-STAT, thereby suppressing STAT3 signaling and decreasing the levels of downstream products including c-Myc. Additionally, WP1066 may upregulate costimulatory molecules including CD80 and CD86 on human microglia, and reverse glioma cancer stem cell (gCSC)-mediated innate and adaptive immune suppression allowing for the restoration of antitumor effector immune responses. The STAT3 pathway is overly active in many cancer types and is implicated in CSC-mediated growth, recurrence and resistance to conventional chemotherapies.",fdaUniiCode:"63V8AIE65T",identifier:"C111042",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C2189"],synonyms:["(S,E)-3-(6-Bromopyridin-2-yl)-2-cyano-N-(1-phenylethyl)acrylamide",c,"WP 1066","WP-1066","WP1066"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSTAT3_Inhibitor_WP1066",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("STAT3_Inhibitor_WP1066","","STAT3 Inhibitor WP1066","2021-10-30T13:18:17.603Z")));
