RO5045337 binds to MDM2, thereby preventing the binding of the MDM2 protein to the transcriptional activation domain of the tumor suppressor protein p53. By preventing this MDM2-p53 interaction, the proteasome-mediated enzymatic degradation of p53 is inhibited and the transcriptional activity of p53 is restored, which may result in the restoration of p53 signaling and thus the p53-mediated induction of tumor cell apoptosis. MDM2, a zinc finger protein, is a negative regulator of the p53 pathway; often overexpressed in cancer cells, it has been implicated in cancer cell proliferation and survival.",fdaUniiCode:"Q8MI0X869M",identifier:"C91724",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C162996"],synonyms:[c,"R7112","RO-5045337","RO5045337"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FMDM2_Antagonist_RO5045337",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","MDM2_Antagonist_RO5045337","MDM2 Antagonist RO5045337","2021-10-30T13:47:30.573Z")));
