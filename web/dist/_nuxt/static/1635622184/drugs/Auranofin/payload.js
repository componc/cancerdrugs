RIDAURA should be added to a comprehensive baseline program, including non-drug therapies. Unlike anti-inflammatory drugs, RIDAURA does not produce an immediate response. Therapeutic effects may be seen after three to four months of treatment, although improvement has not been seen in some patients before six months. When cartilage and bone damage has already occurred, gold cannot reverse structural damage to joints caused by previous disease. The greatest potential benefit occurs in patients with active synovitis, particularly in its early stage. In controlled clinical trials comparing RIDAURA with injectable gold, RIDAURA was associated with fewer dropouts due to adverse reactions, while injectable gold was associated with fewer dropouts for inadequate or poor therapeutic effect. Physicians should consider these findings when deciding on the use of RIDAURA in patients who are candidates for chrysotherapy.",manufacturer:"Sebela Pharmaceuticals Inc.",splSetId:"43ba3de1-ab2e-06f6-e054-00144ff8d46c"}],id:a,nciThesaurus:{casRegistry:"34031-32-8",chebiId:"CHEBI:2922",chemicalFormula:"C20H34AuO9PS",definition:"An orally available, lipophilic, organogold compound, used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, with anti-inflammatory and potential antineoplastic activities. Auranofin interacts with selenocysteine residue within the redox-active domain of mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), thereby blocking the activity of TrxR. As a result, this agent induces mitochondrial oxidative stress leading to the induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, this agent strongly inhibits the JAK1\u002FSTAT3 signal transduction pathway, thereby suppressing expression of immune factors involved in inflammation. TrxR, overexpressed in many cancer cell types, inhibits apoptosis, promotes cell growth and survival and plays a role in resistance to chemotherapy; TrxR catalyzes the reduction of oxidized thioredoxin (Trx) and plays a central role in regulating cellular redox homeostasis.",fdaUniiCode:"3H04W2810V",identifier:"C65242",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C574"],synonyms:["AURANOFIN",a,"Ridaura"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAuranofin",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Auranofin","2021-10-30T13:42:40.243Z")));
