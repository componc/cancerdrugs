Upon intravenous administration, LZM009 binds to PD-1 and inhibits the binding of PD-1 to the PD-1 ligands, programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) and PD-1 ligand 2 (PD-L2). This prevents the activation of PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways, leading to the activation of both T-cells and T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. PD-1 is a transmembrane protein in the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily expressed on activated T-cells that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands. PD-1 plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.",fdaUniiCode:"H6KN31H3XF",identifier:"C153149",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C128037","C129822"],synonyms:["ANTI-PD-1 MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY LZM009",c,"LZM 009","LZM-009","LZM009"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-PD-1_Monoclonal_Antibody_LZM009",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-PD-1_Monoclonal_Antibody_LZM009","Anti-PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody LZM009","2021-10-30T13:34:00.293Z")));
