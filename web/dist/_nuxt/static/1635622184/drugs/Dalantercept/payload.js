Upon administration, dalantercept binds to various ALK1 ligands, preventing activation of tumor cell ALK1 receptors and so inhibiting the ALK1 signaling pathway; growth factor-induced angiogenesis is thus inhibited, which may result in the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and tumor cell death. ALK1 is a type I cell surface receptor with serine\u002Fthreonine kinase activity that mediates signaling by members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) superfamily and plays a key role in angiogenesis; ligands for this receptor include TGFbeta1 and TGFbeta2. The Fc moiety of this fusion protein mediates clearance of ligand-fusion protein complexes by the reticuloendothelial system (RES).",fdaUniiCode:"EGC16R10V0",identifier:"C88296",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C1742"],synonyms:["ACE-041","ALK1-Fc Fusion Protein ACE-041","Activin Receptor-like Kinase 1 Inhibitor ACE-041","DALANTERCEPT",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FDalantercept",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Dalantercept","2021-10-30T13:46:49.243Z")));
