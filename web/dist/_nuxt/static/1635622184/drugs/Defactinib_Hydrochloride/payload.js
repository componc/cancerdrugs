Defactinib inhibits FAK, which may prevent the integrin-mediated activation of several downstream signal transduction pathways, including those involving RAS\u002FMEK\u002FERK and PI3K\u002FAkt, thus inhibiting tumor cell migration, proliferation, survival, and tumor angiogenesis. The tyrosine kinase FAK, a signal transducer for integrins, is normally activated by binding to integrins in the extracellular matrix (ECM) but may be upregulated and constitutively activated in various tumor cell types.",fdaUniiCode:"L2S469LM49",identifier:"C128039",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C129825","C1742","C1967"],synonyms:["Benzamide, N-methyl-4-((4-(((3-(methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino)-2-pyrazinyl)methyl)amino)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyrimidinyl)amino)-, Hydrochloride (1:1)","DEFACTINIB HYDROCHLORIDE",c,"PF-04554878","VS-6063"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FDefactinib_Hydrochloride",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Defactinib_Hydrochloride","","Defactinib Hydrochloride","2021-10-30T13:31:01.303Z")));
