The Fab moiety of naptumomab estafenatox binds to 5T4, an antigen expressed by various tumor cells. In turn, the superantigen binds to both major histocompatibility complex class II molecules and to the T-cell receptor beta chain, which results in a massive activation of T lymphocytes and induces a potent T-cell-mediated killing of tumor cells.",fdaUniiCode:"93T929W6LC",identifier:"C95789",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C20401"],synonyms:["ABR-217620","NAPTUMOMAB ESTAFENATOX",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FNaptumomab_Estafenatox",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Naptumomab_Estafenatox","","Naptumomab Estafenatox","2021-10-30T13:48:12.893Z")));
