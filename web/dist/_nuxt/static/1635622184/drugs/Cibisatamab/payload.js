Cibisatamab contains two antigen-recognition sites: one for human CD3, a T-cell surface antigen, and one for human CEA, a tumor-associated antigen that is specifically expressed on certain tumor cells. Upon intravenous administration, cibisatamab binds to both T-cells and CEA-expressing tumor cells, which cross-links the T-cells with the tumor cells. This may result in a potent cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against CEA-expressing tumor cells. CEA is overexpressed in many cancer cell types.",fdaUniiCode:"ZAM5J1ATF2",identifier:"C120097",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C28227"],synonyms:["CIBISATAMAB",a,"RG-7802","RG7802","RO6958688","WHO 10636"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FCibisatamab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Cibisatamab","","2021-10-30T13:19:57.633Z")));
