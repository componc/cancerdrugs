Upon administration, zevorcabtagene autoleucel specifically recognize and induce selective toxicity against BCMA-expressing tumor cells. BCMA, a tumor-specific antigen and a receptor for both a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) and B-cell activating factor (BAFF), is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) and plays a key role in the survival of B-lymphocytes and plasma cells.
