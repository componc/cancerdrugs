Upon administration, simotaxel binds to tubulin, promotes microtubule assembly and stabilization, and prevents microtubule depolymerization. This results in G2\u002FM arrest, apoptosis and the inhibition of cell proliferation in susceptible tumor cells. This agent is a poor substrate for P-glycoprotein-related drug resistance mechanisms; therefore, it may be useful for treating multi-drug resistant tumors.
