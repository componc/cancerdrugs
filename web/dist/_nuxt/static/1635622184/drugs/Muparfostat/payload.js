Muparfostat inhibits the endo-beta-D-glucuronidase heparanase, which may interfere with the heparanase-mediated degradation of heparan-sulfate proteoglycans in extracellular matrices, an important step in the metastatic process. This agent may also bind with high affinity to the heparan sulfate-binding domains of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factors 1 and 2, thereby reducing their functional activities and inhibiting VEGF and FGF stimulation of tumor angiogenesis. Increased heparanase activity has been implicated in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis.",fdaUniiCode:"P2BKS6T40H",identifier:"C38690",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C1971","C263"],synonyms:["6-O-(dihydrogen Phosphate)-2,3,4-tris-O-(hydrogen Sulfate)-alpha-d-mannopyranosyl-(1-\u003Epoly(3)-2,4,6-tris-O-(hydrogen Sulfate)-alpha-d-mannopyranosyl-(1-\u003E)2)-1,3,4,6-tetrakis-O-(hydrogen Sulfate)-d-mannopyranose","MUPARFOSTAT",a,"PI 88","PI-88","Phosphomannopentose Sulfate PI-88","Sulfated Phosphomanno-oligosaccharide PI-88","alpha-D-Mannan, (1-\u003E3)-, 6-(Dihydrogen Phosphate) Tris(Hydrogen Sulfate)"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FMuparfostat",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Muparfostat","","2021-10-30T13:39:34.983Z")));
