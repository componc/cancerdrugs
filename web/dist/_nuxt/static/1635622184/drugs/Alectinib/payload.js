Upon administration, alectinib binds to and inhibits ALK kinase, ALK fusion proteins as well as the gatekeeper mutation ALKL1196M known as one of the mechanisms of acquired resistance to small-molecule kinase inhibitors. The inhibition leads to disruption of ALK-mediated signaling and eventually inhibits tumor cell growth in ALK-overexpressing tumor cells. ALK belongs to the insulin receptor superfamily and plays an important role in nervous system development. ALK dysregulation and gene rearrangements are associated with a series of tumors.",fdaUniiCode:"LIJ4CT1Z3Y",identifier:"C101790",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C141136"],synonyms:["5H-benzo(b)carbazole-3-carbonitrile, 9-Ethyl-6,11-dihydro-6,6-dimethyl-8-(4-(4-morpholinyl)-1-piperidinyl)-11-oxo-","AF-802","AF802","ALECTINIB",b,a,"CH5424802","RG7853","RO5424802"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAlectinib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Alectinib","Alecensa","2021-10-30T13:17:04.863Z")));
