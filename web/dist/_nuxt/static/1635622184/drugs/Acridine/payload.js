Acridine and its derivatives intercalate within DNA and RNA by forming hydrogen-bonds and stacking between base pairs resulting in DNA crosslinks and strand breaks. In addition, acridine and its derivatives are a potent inhibitor of topoisomerase II enzyme. This results in the inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis, predominantly occurring during S phase of the cell cycle and ultimately leads to cell death.",fdaUniiCode:"42NI1P5Q1X",identifier:"C203",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C582"],synonyms:["ACRIDINE",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAcridine",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Acridine","","2021-10-30T13:37:13.553Z")));
