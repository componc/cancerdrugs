Complementary to the template region of telomerase RNA (hTR), imetelstat acts as a competitive enzyme inhibitor that binds and blocks the active site of the enzyme (a \"telomerase template antagonist\"), a mechanism of action which differs from that for the antisense oligonucleotide-mediated inhibition of telomerase activity through telomerase mRNA binding. Inhibition of telomerase activity in tumor cells by imetelstat results in telomere shortening, which leads to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.",fdaUniiCode:"2AW48LAZ4I",identifier:"C84511",preferredName:b,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C1291","C2826"],synonyms:["DNA, d(3'-amino-3'-deoxy-P-thio)(T-A-G-G-G-T-T-A-G-A-C-A-A), 5'-[O-[2-hydroxy-3- [(1-oxohexadecyl)amino]propyl] hydrogen phosphorothioate], Sodium Salt (1:13)","GRN163L","GRN163L, Sodium Salt","IMETELSTAT SODIUM",b]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FImetelstat_Sodium",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Imetelstat_Sodium","Imetelstat Sodium","2021-10-30T13:46:16.883Z")));
