Upon intravenous administration, vofatamab specifically binds to and inhibits both wild-type and mutated forms of FGFR3. This may result in the inhibition of FGFR3 phosphorylation, and thereby preventing its activation and FGFR3-mediated signal transduction pathways. This results in the inhibition of cell proliferation and the induction of cell death in FGFR3-expressing tumor cells. FGFR3, a receptor tyrosine kinase upregulated or mutated in many tumor cell types, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation.",fdaUniiCode:"JMH6YR91PG",identifier:"C116863",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C133879"],synonyms:["B-701","MFGR-1877S","MFGR1877A","MFGR1877S","RG-7444","VOFATAMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FVofatamab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Vofatamab","","2021-10-30T13:19:19.603Z")));
