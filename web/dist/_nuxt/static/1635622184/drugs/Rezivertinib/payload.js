Upon administration, rezivertinib specifically and covalently binds to and inhibits selective EGFR mutations, with particularly high selectivity against the T790M mutation, which prevents EGFR mutant-mediated signaling and leads to cell death in EGFR mutant-expressing tumor cells. Compared to some other EGFR inhibitors, BPI-7711 may have therapeutic benefits in tumors with T790M-mediated drug resistance. This agent shows minimal activity against wild-type EGFR (wt EGFR), and does not cause dose-limiting toxicities that occur during the use of non-selective EGFR inhibitors, which also inhibit wt EGFR. EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase mutated in many tumor cell types, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization.",fdaUniiCode:"U65F5M6BD5",identifier:"C154286",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C2167"],synonyms:["BPI 7711","BPI-7711","BPI7711","EGFR Mutant-specific Inhibitor BPI-7711","REZIVERTINIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FRezivertinib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Rezivertinib","","2021-10-30T13:34:06.883Z")));
