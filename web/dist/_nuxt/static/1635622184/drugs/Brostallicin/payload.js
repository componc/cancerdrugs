Brostallicin binds to DNA minor groove DNA, after having formed a highly reactive glutathione (GSH)-brostallicin complex in the presence of the enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST), which is overexpressed in cancer cells; DNA replication and cell division are inhibited, resulting in tumor cell death. Compared to typical MGBs, this agent appears to bind covalently to DNA in a different manner and its activity does not depend on a functional DNA mismatch repair (MMR) mechanism. Accordingly, brostallicin may be effective against MMR-defective tumors that are refractory to various anticancer agents.",fdaUniiCode:"RPC6R41K4I",identifier:"C1889",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C2115","C446"],synonyms:["4-(2-Bromoacrylamido)-N'''-(2-guanidinoethyl)-1,1',1',1'''-tetramethyl-N,4':N',4':N',4'''-quater(pyrrole-2-carboxamide)","BROSTALLICIN",a,"PNU-166196"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FBrostallicin",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Brostallicin","2021-10-30T13:37:05.753Z")));
