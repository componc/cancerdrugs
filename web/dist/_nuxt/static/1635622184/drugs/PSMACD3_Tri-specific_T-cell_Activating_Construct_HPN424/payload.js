Upon administration, PSMA\u002FCD3 tri-specific T-cell antibody construct HPN424 targets and binds PSMA on tumor cells and CD3 on cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs), thereby bringing PSMA-expressing tumor cells and CTLs together, which results in the CTL-mediated cell death of PSMA-expressing tumor cells. The albumin-binding domain targets and binds to serum albumin, thereby extending the serum half-life of HPN424. PSMA is overexpressed on the surface of metastatic and hormone-refractory prostate tumor cells.",fdaUniiCode:"ZAA5KE2UAS",identifier:"C156681",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129820","C176017"],synonyms:["Anti-PSMA\u002FCD3 TriTAC HPN424","HPN 424","HPN-424","HPN424",c,"PSMA\u002FCD3 TriTAC HPN424","PSMA\u002FCD3-specific TriTAC HPN424","TriTAC HPN424"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FPSMACD3_Tri-specific_T-cell_Activating_Construct_HPN424",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","PSMACD3_Tri-specific_T-cell_Activating_Construct_HPN424","PSMA\u002FCD3 Tri-specific T-cell Activating Construct HPN424","2021-10-30T13:34:24.953Z")));
