Upon administration, asunercept binds to the CD95 ligand (CD95L) and blocks the binding of CD95L to the CD95 receptor. In tumor cells, blockage of CD95L-mediated signaling pathways may prevent cell migration and invasive cell growth; in healthy cells, blockage of CD95L-mediated signaling pathways may prevent apoptosis and may protect cell damage. Activation of the CD95 receptor plays an important role in the initiation of apoptosis in healthy cells or the invasive growth of cancer cells.",fdaUniiCode:"F333OQQ9UV",identifier:"C90562",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C1512"],synonyms:["APG-101","APG101","ASUNERCEPT","Apocept",a,"CAN-008","CAN008","CD95-Fc Fusion Protein CAN008","Fas-Fc Fusion Protein CAN008"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAsunercept",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Asunercept","","2021-10-30T13:47:09.023Z")));
