Caracemide inhibits ribonuclease reductase, resulting in decreased DNA synthesis and tumor growth; it also inhibits acetylcholinesterase.  In vivo, caracemide contributes to the formation of the neurotoxin methyl isocyanate; this effect, along with the agent's acetylcholinesterase activity, may be responsible for the severe central nervous system toxicity observed in clinical trials.",fdaUniiCode:"H74F6J185A",identifier:"C1037",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C2150"],synonyms:["Acetamide, N-[(Methylamino)carbonyl]-N-[[(methylamino)carbonyl]oxy]-(9CI)","Acetamide, N-[(methylamino)carbonyl]-N-[[(methylamino)carbonyl]oxy]- (9CI)","CARACEMIDE",a,"N-Acetyl-N-(methylcarbamoyloxy)-N'-methylurea"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FCaracemide",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Caracemide","2021-10-30T13:17:26.703Z")));
