Upon administration, RO5429083 binds to the constant region of the extracellular domain of CD44, thereby preventing the activation of various CD44-mediated signal transduction pathways. This may lead to a reduction in the proliferation of CD44-expressing tumor stem cells. CD44, a transmembrane glycoprotein and hyaluronic acid receptor, is expressed in healthy tissue and overexpressed in numerous cancer cell types; it plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation, migration and survival.",fdaUniiCode:"0T69CA5LQA",identifier:"C116881",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:[c,"RG 7356","RO-5429083","RO5429083"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-CD44_Monoclonal_Antibody_RO5429083",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-CD44_Monoclonal_Antibody_RO5429083","Anti-CD44 Monoclonal Antibody RO5429083","2021-10-30T13:19:22.783Z")));
