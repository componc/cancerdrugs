Selenium, administered in the form of sodium selenite, is reduced to hydrogen selenide (H2Se) in the presence of glutathione (GSH) and subsequently generates superoxide radicals upon reaction with oxygen. This may inhibit the expression and activity of the transcription factor Sp1; in turn Sp1 down-regulates androgen receptor (AR) expression and blocks AR signaling. Eventually, selenium may induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells and inhibit tumor cell proliferation.",fdaUniiCode:"HIW548RQ3W",identifier:"C87346",preferredName:e,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C1505"],synonyms:["Disodium Selenium Trioxide","SODIUM SELENITE","Selenious Acid Disodium Salt","Selenious Acid, Sodium Salt (1:2)",e]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSodium_Selenite",extension:".json",createdAt:f,updatedAt:f}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Free Radical","Deseret Biologicals, Inc.","Sodium_Selenite","HOMEOPATHIC INDICATIONS: For temporary relief of symptoms related to Free Radical Toxicity including tingling in hands and feet, mood changes, frequent colds, poor digestion, fatigue, and occasional constipation.** **These statements are based upon homeopathic principles.
