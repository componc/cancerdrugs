Upon administration, tepoditamab binds to both CD3 on T-cells and CLEC12A expressed on malignant cells, such as myeloid blasts, atypical progenitor cells and leukemic stem cells (LSCs). This results in the cross-linking of T-cells with tumor cells, and induces a potent cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against CLEC12A-expressing tumor cells. CLEC12A, a myeloid differentiation antigen and member of the C-type lectin\u002FC-type lectin-like domain (CTL\u002FCTLD) superfamily, is overexpressed on myeloid leukemia cells, but not on normal early hematopoietic progenitors, including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).",fdaUniiCode:"LK0H7J2V3C",identifier:"C148141",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C28227"],synonyms:["Anti-CLEC12A x CD3 Bispecific Antibody MCLA117","Anti-CLEC12A\u002FAnti-CD3 Bispecific Antibody MCLA117","Bispecific Antibody MCLA-117","Immunoglobulin G1, Bispecific, Anti-(C-type lectin CLEC12A and CD3 Antigen) (Human Monoclonal MCLA-117 Gamma1-chain), Disulfide with Human Monoclonal MCLA-117 Kappa-chain, Dimer","MCLA 117","MCLA-117","MCLA117","TEPODITAMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTepoditamab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Tepoditamab","","2021-10-30T13:33:08.123Z")));
