Upon intravenous administration, talacotuzumab binds to and neutralizes CD123. This may inhibit IL-3-dependent signaling and may inhibit proliferation and differentiation in CD123-positive tumor cells. CSL362 contains an engineered Fc region which increases its binding affinity to Fc-gamma receptors on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells thereby initiating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). CD123 is normally expressed on committed blood progenitor cells in the bone marrow; its overexpression is associated with increased leukemic cell proliferation and aggressiveness.",fdaUniiCode:"X8JR0I7JE1",identifier:"C102784",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:["Anti-IL-3 Receptor Alpha Monoclonal Antibody CSL362","CSL 362","CSL362","JNJ-56022473","JNJ56022473","TALACOTUZUMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTalacotuzumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Talacotuzumab","","2021-10-30T13:17:13.813Z")));
