Upon administration, cudarolimab selectively binds to and activates OX40. Receptor activation induces proliferation of memory and effector T-lymphocytes and results in a T-cell-mediated immune response against tumor cells, which leads to tumor cell lysis. OX40, a cell surface glycoprotein and member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF), is expressed on T-lymphocytes and provides a co-stimulatory signal that promotes both the proliferation and survival of activated T-cells.",fdaUniiCode:"DT958C4NWR",identifier:"C158507",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C96040"],synonyms:["Anti-OX40 Monoclonal Antibody IBI101","CUDAROLIMAB",a,"IBI 101","IBI-101","IBI101"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FCudarolimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Cudarolimab","","2021-10-30T13:34:47.663Z")));
