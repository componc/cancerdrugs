Upon oral administration, panulisib inhibits the activity of all four kinases. This prevents PI3K\u002FmTOR and ALK-1-mediated signaling pathways and may lead to the inhibition of cancer cell growth in PI3K\u002FmTOR-overexpressing tumor cells and angiogenesis in ALK-1-overexpressing endothelial cells. Also, by inhibiting DNA-PK, this agent inhibits the ability of tumor cells to repair damaged DNA. The PI3K\u002FmTOR pathway is upregulated in a variety of tumors and plays an important role in regulating cancer cell proliferation, growth, and survival. ALK-1, a member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b) type I receptor family, is overexpressed on endothelial cells in a variety of tumor types and increases endothelial cell proliferation and migration. DNA-PK is activated upon DNA damage and plays a key role in repairing double-stranded DNA breaks.",fdaUniiCode:"S9WA04F921",identifier:"C104292",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C2152"],synonyms:["AK15176","P7170","PANULISIB","PI3K\u002FmTOR\u002FALK-1\u002FDNA-PK Inhibitor P7170",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FPanulisib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Panulisib","","2021-10-30T13:17:35.043Z")));
