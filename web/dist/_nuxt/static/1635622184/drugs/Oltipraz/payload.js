Oltipraz induces phase II detoxification enzymes, such as glutathione S transferase (GST) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). The induction of detoxification enzymes enhances the detoxification of certain cancer-causing agents, thereby enhancing their elimination and preventing carcinogen-induced DNA damages. Although the exact mechanism through which the anti-angiogenesis effect remains to be fully elucidated, oltipraz maybe able to modulate the expression of a number of angiogenic factors, thereby blocking the sustained and focal neovascularization in multiple tumor cell types.",fdaUniiCode:"6N510JUL1Y",identifier:"C1177",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C1742","C54629","C54630"],synonyms:["3H-1,2-Dithiole-3-thione, 4-methyl-5-pyrazinyl-","3H-1,2-Dithiole-3-thione,4-methyl-5-pyrazinyl","4-Methyl-5-(pyrazinyl)-3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione","4-Methyl-5-pyrazinyl-3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione","5-(2-Pyrazinyl)-4-methyl-1,2-dithiol-3-thione","5-[2-Pyrazinyl]-4-methyl-1,2-3-thione","OLTIPRAZ",a,"RP-35,972","oltipraz"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FOltipraz",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Oltipraz","2021-10-30T13:19:27.633Z")));
