Duligotuzumab binds to both EGFR and HER3 and inhibits their activation. This may prevent EGFR\u002FHER3-mediated signaling and inhibit EGFR\u002FHER3-dependent tumor cell proliferation. In addition, MEHD7945A induces antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against EGR\u002FHER3-expressing tumor cells. EGFR and HER3, members of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of receptor tyrosine kinases, are frequently overexpressed in tumors; their expression is associated with both poor prognosis and drug resistance.",fdaUniiCode:"8PMF8YQX2T",identifier:"C116628",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C20401"],synonyms:["DULIGOTUZUMAB","Duligotumab",a,"MEHD 7945A","MEHD-7945A","MEHD7945A","RG 7597"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FDuligotuzumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Duligotuzumab","","2021-10-30T13:19:10.543Z")));
