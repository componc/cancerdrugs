Upon administration, lenzilumab binds to and neutralizes GM-CSF. This prevents GM-CSF binding to the GM-CSF receptor, which is a heterodimeric protein expressed on myeloid progenitor cells, and prevents GM-CSF-mediated signaling. This may induce apoptosis in and inhibit proliferation of cancer cells that overproduce GM-CSF. GM-CSF plays a key role in the differentiation and proliferation of monocytes, macrophages and granulocytes; elevated levels of GM-CSF are associated with certain autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, and cancers.",fdaUniiCode:"IE4X6497XK",identifier:"C125081",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C172641"],synonyms:["Immunoglobulin G1-kappa, Anti-(Homo sapiens CSF2 (Colony Stimulating Factor 2 (Granulocyte-Macrophage), Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor, GM-CSF)), Homo sapiens Monoclonal Antibody","KB 003","KB003","LENZILUMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FLenzilumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Lenzilumab","","2021-10-30T13:30:29.223Z")));
