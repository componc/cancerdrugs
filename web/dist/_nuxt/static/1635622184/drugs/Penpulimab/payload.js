Upon administration, penpulimab targets, binds to and inhibits PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore immune function through the activation of T-cells and T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. PD-1, a transmembrane protein in the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) expressed on T-cells, functions as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) or 2 (PD-L2); it plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.",fdaUniiCode:"IBS1BZ4E4I",identifier:"C155879",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C128037","C129822"],synonyms:["AK 105","AK-105","AK105","Anti-PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody AK105","PENPULIMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FPenpulimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Penpulimab","","2021-10-30T13:34:14.653Z")));
