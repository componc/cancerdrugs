Upon administration, adebrelimab specifically targets and binds to PD-L1, blocking its binding to and activation of its receptor programmed death 1 (PD-1). This reverses T-cell inactivation caused by PD-1\u002FPD-L1 signaling and enhances the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated anti-tumor immune response against PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. PD-L1 is overexpressed by many human cancer cell types. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion. PD-1, a transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed on activated T-cells, is a negative regulator of the immune system that limits the expansion and survival of CD8-positive T-cells.",fdaUniiCode:"1XBY50W1OX",identifier:"C148535",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C128057","C129822"],synonyms:["ADEBRELIMAB",a,"HTI-1088","SHR-1316"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAdebrelimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Adebrelimab","","2021-10-30T13:33:15.273Z")));
