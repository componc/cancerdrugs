Upon intratumoral administration, one shRNA unit with a perfectly matched sequence renders the suppression of STMN1 mRNA translation (mRNA sequestration and cleavage-independent degradation) while the other unit with an imperfectly matched sequence renders STMN1 mRNA degradation via RNase H-like cleavage (cleavage-dependent mRNA silencing). The suppression of STMN1 expression in tumor cells result in a reduction of tumor cell proliferation. STMN1, a ubiquitous cytosolic phosphoprotein and tubulin modulator that plays a key role in mitosis, is overexpressed in a variety of tumors and correlates with poor prognosis.",fdaUniiCode:"0TG7ZQ45R5",identifier:"C99639",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129821"],synonyms:["DNA PLASMID (PBI-SHRNA STMN1)","pbi-shRNA STMN1 LP",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002Fpbi-shRNA_STMN1_Lipoplex",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","pbi-shRNA_STMN1_Lipoplex","pbi-shRNA STMN1 Lipoplex","2021-10-30T13:49:05.203Z")));
