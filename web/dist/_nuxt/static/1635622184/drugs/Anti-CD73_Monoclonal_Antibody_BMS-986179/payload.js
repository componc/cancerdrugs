Upon administration, anti-CD73 monoclonal antibody BMS-986179 targets and binds to CD73, leading to clustering and internalization of CD73. This prevents CD73-mediated conversion of extracellular adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine and decreases the amount of free adenosine. This prevents adenosine-mediated suppression of lymphocyte activity and increases the activity of CD8-positive effector cells. This also activates macrophages, and reduces the activity of both myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T-lymphocytes. By abrogating the inhibitory effect on the immune system and enhancing the cytotoxic T-cell-mediated immune response against cancer cells, tumor cell growth is decreased. CD73, a plasma membrane protein belonging to the 5'-nucleotidase (NTase) family, is upregulated on a number of cancer cell types and catalyzes the conversion of extracellular nucleotides, such as AMP, to membrane-permeable nucleosides, such as adenosine; it plays a key role in adenosine-mediated immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment.",fdaUniiCode:"7PO9B4VQ1U",identifier:"C132266",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C176988"],synonyms:[c,"BMS 986179","BMS-986179"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-CD73_Monoclonal_Antibody_BMS-986179",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-CD73_Monoclonal_Antibody_BMS-986179","Anti-CD73 Monoclonal Antibody BMS-986179","2021-10-30T13:31:35.183Z")));
