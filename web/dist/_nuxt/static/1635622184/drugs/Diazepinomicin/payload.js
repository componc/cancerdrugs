Diazepinomicin binds to and inhibits Ras kinase, thereby preventing the phosphorylation and activation of proteins downstream of the Ras signal transduction pathway, including serine\u002Fthreonine kinase RAF (BRAF) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1 and ERK-2), that play a crucial role in regulating cell growth and survival. Diazepinomicin also selectively binds to the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (BZRP), a receptor highly expressed in certain cancer cells, thus inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in BZRP-expressing cells. In addition, diazepinomicin is able to cross the blood-brain barrier, thereby reaching therapeutic concentrations in the brain.",fdaUniiCode:"YPH994Y0RF",identifier:"C62508",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C1012","C2189"],synonyms:["11h-dibenzo(B,E)(1,4)diazepin-11-one, 5,10-dihydro-4,6,8-trihydroxy-10-((2E,6E)-3,7,11-trimethyl-2,6,10-dodecatrien-1-yl)-","BU-4664L","DIAZEPINOMICIN",a,"ECO-4601","TLN-4601"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FDiazepinomicin",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Diazepinomicin","2021-10-30T13:42:07.843Z")));
