Sepantronium bromide selectively inhibits survivin expression in tumor cells, resulting in inhibition of survivin antiapoptotic activity (via the extrinsic or intrinsic apoptotic pathways) and tumor cell apoptosis. Survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) gene family, is expressed during embryonal development and is absent in most normal, terminally differentiated tissues; upregulated in a variety of human cancers, its expression in tumors is associated with a more aggressive phenotype, shorter survival times, and a decreased response to chemotherapy.",fdaUniiCode:"7H5Q4J1CM5",identifier:"C61091",preferredName:b,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C2189"],synonyms:["1H-Naphth(2,3-d)imidazolium, 4,9-dihydro-1-(2-methoxyethyl)-2-methyl-4,9-dioxo-3-(pyrazinylmethyl)-, Bromide","SEPANTRONIUM BROMIDE",b,"Survivin Inhibitor YM155","YM-155"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSepantronium_Bromide",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Sepantronium_Bromide","Sepantronium Bromide","2021-10-30T13:41:20.603Z")));
