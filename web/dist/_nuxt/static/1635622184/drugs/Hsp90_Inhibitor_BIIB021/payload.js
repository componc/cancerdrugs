HSP90, a chaperon protein upregulated in a variety of tumor cells, regulates the folding and degradation of many oncogenic signaling proteins. HSP90 inhibitor BIIB021 specifically blocks active HSP90, thereby inhibiting its chaperon function and promoting the degradation of oncogenic signaling proteins involved in tumor cell proliferation and survival. As a result, CNF2024 has the potential to inhibit the growth of a wide range of cancer cells in both solid tumors and blood-based cancers.",fdaUniiCode:"851B9FQ7Q0",identifier:"C62517",preferredName:b,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C156880"],synonyms:["BIIB-021","BIIB021","CNF2024","Hsp90 Antagonist CNF2024",b]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FHsp90_Inhibitor_BIIB021",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Hsp90_Inhibitor_BIIB021","Hsp90 Inhibitor BIIB021","2021-10-30T13:42:10.503Z")));
