When injected directly into the prostate, topsalysin is hydrolyzed to the active toxin aerolysin by the serine protease prostate specific antigen (PSA), a protein overexpressed by prostate cancers and prostate cells in hyperplastic prostatic tissue. Aerolysin molecules then oligomerize to form ring-like heptamers that are incorporated into the lipid bilayers of cell membranes, forming large membrane channels and resulting in the leakage of cellular contents and lysis of PSA-expressing prostate cells.",fdaUniiCode:"LSA9D0A43Q",identifier:"C64779",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C163758"],synonyms:["PORxin 302","PRX 302","PSA-PAH1","Pore-forming Protein (Synthetic Proaerolysin) Fusion Protein with Prostate-specific Antigen (Human)","TOPSALYSIN",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTopsalysin",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Topsalysin","","2021-10-30T13:42:37.743Z")));
