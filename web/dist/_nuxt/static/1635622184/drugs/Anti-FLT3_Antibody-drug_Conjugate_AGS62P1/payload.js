Upon administration of ADC AGS62P1, the antibody moiety targets and binds to FLT3. Upon antibody\u002Fantigen binding and internalization, the microtubule-targeting agent binds to and inhibits tubulin polymerization, which results in G2\u002FM phase arrest and tumor cell apoptosis. The site-specific conjugation of the cytotoxic agent to the antibody, through pAcF, improves the biophysical properties of AGS62P1, increases payload distribution and stability, and optimizes its efficacy. FLT3, a class III tyrosine kinase receptor, is overexpressed or mutated in most B lineage, acute lymphoblastic leukemias and acute myeloid leukemias.",fdaUniiCode:"37I4D4Q7S2",identifier:"C129937",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129823","C163790","C575"],synonyms:["ADC AGS62P1","AGS62P1",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-FLT3_Antibody-drug_Conjugate_AGS62P1",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-FLT3_Antibody-drug_Conjugate_AGS62P1","Anti-FLT3 Antibody-drug Conjugate AGS62P1","2021-10-30T13:31:16.913Z")));
