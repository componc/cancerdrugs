Telatinib binds to and inhibits the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) type 2 and 3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRb) and c-Kit, which may result in the inhibition of angiogenesis and cellular proliferation in tumors in which these receptors are upregulated. These telatinib-inhibited receptor protein tyrosine kinases are overexpressed or mutated in many tumor cell types and may play key roles in tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation. 17-AAG is a synthetic analogue of the benzoquinone ansamycin antibiotic geldanamycin and has also been found to inhibit the molecular chaperone Hsp90.",fdaUniiCode:"571LVA9UMS",identifier:"C87837",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C1742","C1967"],synonyms:["17-Demethoxy-17-Allylaminogeldanamycin Mesylate","TELATINIB MESYLATE",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTelatinib_Mesylate",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Telatinib_Mesylate","Telatinib Mesylate","2021-10-30T13:46:44.453Z")));
