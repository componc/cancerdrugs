Upon administration, berzosertib selectively binds to and inhibits ATR kinase activity and prevents ATR-mediated signaling in the ATR-checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) signaling pathway. This prevents DNA damage checkpoint activation, disrupts DNA damage repair, and induces tumor cell apoptosis. ATR, a serine\u002Fthreonine protein kinase upregulated in a variety of cancer cell types, plays a key role in DNA repair, cell cycle progression, and survival; it is activated by DNA damage caused during DNA replication-associated stress.",fdaUniiCode:"L423PRV3V3",identifier:"C116355",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C155926"],synonyms:["2-Pyrazinamine, 3-(3-(4-((Methylamino)methyl)phenyl)-5-isoxazolyl)-5-(4-((1-methylethyl)sulfonyl)phenyl)-","BERZOSERTIB",a,"M 6620","M6620","VX 970","VX-970","VX970"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FBerzosertib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Berzosertib","","2021-10-30T13:19:05.753Z")));
