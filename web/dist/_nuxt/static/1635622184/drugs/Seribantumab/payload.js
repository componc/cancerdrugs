ErbB3, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of receptor tyrosine kinases, is frequently overexpressed in solid tumors, including breast, lung, and colorectal tumors of epithelial origin; it has no active kinase domain itself but is activated through heterodimerization with other members of the EGFR receptor family that do.",fdaUniiCode:"1N3L70MDFX",identifier:"C78859",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C20401"],synonyms:["MM-121","SAR 256212","SERIBANTUMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSeribantumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Seribantumab","","2021-10-30T13:45:21.783Z")));
