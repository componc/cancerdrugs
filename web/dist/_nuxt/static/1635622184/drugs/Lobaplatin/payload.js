Lobaplatin forms highly reactive, charged, platinum complexes that bind to nucleophilic groups such as GC- and AG-rich sites in DNA, inducing intrastrand DNA cross-links. These cross-links will ultimately result in induction of apoptosis and cell growth inhibition. Compared to first and second generation platinum compounds, lobaplatin appears to be more stable, less toxic, have a better therapeutic index and may overcome tumor resistance.",fdaUniiCode:"OX5XK1JD8C",identifier:"C1434",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Inorganic Chemical",subclassOf:["C1450"],synonyms:["1,2-diammino-methy lcyclobutane-platinum (II) lactate","D-19466","LOBAPLATIN",a,"lobaplatin"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FLobaplatin",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Lobaplatin","2021-10-30T13:32:39.493Z")));
