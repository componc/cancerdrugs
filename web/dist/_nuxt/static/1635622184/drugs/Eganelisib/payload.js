Upon administration, eganelisib prevents the activation of the PI3K-gamma-mediated signaling pathways, which may lead to a reduction in cellular proliferation in PI3K-gamma-expressing tumor cells. In addition, this agent is able to modulate anti-tumor immune responses and inhibit tumor-mediated immunosuppression. Unlike other isoforms of PI3K, the gamma isoform is overexpressed in certain tumor cell types and immune cells; its expression increases tumor cell proliferation and survival. By selectively targeting the gamma isoform, PI3K signaling in normal, non-neoplastic cells is minimally or not affected, which results in a reduced side effect profile.",fdaUniiCode:"FOF5155FMZ",identifier:"C125471",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C2152"],synonyms:["EGANELISIB",a,"IPI 549","IPI-549"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FEganelisib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Eganelisib","","2021-10-30T13:30:31.633Z")));
