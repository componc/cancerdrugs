Anti-GITR antibody GWN 323 binds to and activates GITRs found on multiple types of T-cells. This stimulates the immune system, induces both the activation and proliferation of tumor-antigen-specific T effector cells (Teff), and suppresses the function of activated T regulatory cells (Tregs). This leads to tumor cell eradication. GITR, a member of the TNF receptor superfamily and T-cell receptor co-stimulator, is expressed on the surface of multiple immune cell types, including Tregs, Teffs, B-cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. Inappropriately activated Tregs suppress both Teffs and T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling.",fdaUniiCode:"WYJ05POC5C",identifier:"C128028",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C128058","C129822"],synonyms:[c,"GWN 323","GWN-323","GWN323"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-GITR_Monoclonal_Antibody_GWN_323",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-GITR_Monoclonal_Antibody_GWN_323","Anti-GITR Monoclonal Antibody GWN 323","2021-10-30T13:31:00.823Z")));
