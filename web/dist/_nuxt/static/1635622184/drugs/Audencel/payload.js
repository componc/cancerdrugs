The monocyte-derived immature DCs are loaded with autologous tumor cell lysates and are subsequently exposed to LPS and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Upon administration of audencel, the mature DCs migrate into the lymph nodes, express the immune stimulatory cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) and activate the immune system by promoting the activation of natural killer (NK) cells and induce a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against tumor cells, which may result in immune-mediated tumor cell death and inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. Exposure to LPS and IFN-gamma allows the maturation of DCs and optimizes the presentation of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) by DCs to T-lymphocytes.",fdaUniiCode:"H2CDQ1PWN7",identifier:"C123928",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Cell",subclassOf:["C129826","C28310"],synonyms:["AUDENCEL","AV0113","AV0113 DC-CIT","AV0113 Dendritic Cell Cancer Immunotherapeutic",a,"Autologous DC-based Immunotherapeutic AV0113"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAudencel",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Audencel","","2021-10-30T13:30:13.753Z")));
