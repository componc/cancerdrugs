Edicotinib blocks the receptor-ligand interaction between FMS and its ligand CSF1, thereby preventing autophosphorylation of FMS. As a result, unphosphorylated FMS can not activate FMS-mediated signaling pathways, thus potentially inhibiting cell proliferation in FMS-overexpressed tumor cells. FMS, a tyrosine kinase receptor, is overexpressed in certain tumor cell types and plays an essential role in macrophage differentiation, recruitment, and activation as well as the regulation of cell proliferation.",fdaUniiCode:"3NU609VYNF",identifier:"C101519",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C1967"],synonyms:["1H-Imidazole-2-carboxamide, 5-Cyano-N-(2-(4,4-dimethyl-1-cyclohexen-1-yl)-6-(tetrahydro-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-2H-pyran-4-yl)-3-pyridinyl)-","4-Cyano-1H-imidazole-2-carboxylic acid N-(2-(4,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-enyl)-6-(2,2,6,6-tetramethyltetrahydropyran-4-yl)pyridin-3-yl)amide","4-Cyano-N-(2-(4,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-en-1-yl)-6-(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl)pyridin-3-yl)-1H-imidazole-2-carboxamide","EDICOTINIB",a,"JNJ-40346527"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FEdicotinib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Edicotinib","","2021-10-30T13:17:01.343Z")));
