REGN4018 contains two antigen-recognition sites: one for human CD3, a T cell surface antigen that is part of the T cell receptor complex, and one for human mucin 16 (MUC16, cancer antigen 125; CA125; FLJ14303), a member of the mucin family of glycoproteins that is overexpressed by several epithelial cancers, including ovarian cancer. Upon administration, REGN4018 binds to both T-cells and MUC16-expressing tumor cells, which cross-links the T-cells to the tumor cells, and may result in a potent cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against the MUC16-expressing tumor cells.",fdaUniiCode:"6BUL1G4D60",identifier:"C153129",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C20401"],synonyms:["Anti-MUC16 x Anti-CD3 REGN4018",c,"REGN 4018","REGN-4018","REGN4018"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-MUC16CD3_Bispecific_Antibody_REGN4018",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-MUC16CD3_Bispecific_Antibody_REGN4018","Anti-MUC16\u002FCD3 Bispecific Antibody REGN4018","2021-10-30T13:33:59.313Z")));
