Upon administration and internalization by LIV-1-positive tumor cells, ladiratuzumab vedotin undergoes enzymatic cleavage to release MMAE into the cytosol. In turn, MMAE binds to and inhibits tubulin polymerization, which may result in G2\u002FM phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in LIV-1-expressing tumor cells. LIV-1, a member of the zinc transporter family, is expressed in several types of solid tumors and plays a key role in tumor cell progression and metastasis. The linkage system in ladiratuzumab vedotin is highly stable in plasma, resulting in cytotoxic specificity against LIV-1-positive cells.",fdaUniiCode:"VM4G5D1A60",identifier:"C112001",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C129823","C20401"],synonyms:["LADIRATUZUMAB VEDOTIN",c,"SGN-LIV1A"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FLadiratuzumab_Vedotin",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Ladiratuzumab_Vedotin","","Ladiratuzumab Vedotin","2021-10-30T13:18:26.213Z")));
