Gold sodium thiomalate (GST) appears to inhibit the activity of atypical protein kinase C iota (PKCiota) by forming a cysteinyl-aurothiomalate adduct with the cysteine residue Cys-69 within the PB1 binding domain of PKCiota. This prevents the binding of Par6 (Partitioning defective protein 6) to PKCiota, thereby inhibiting PKCiota-mediated oncogenic signaling, which may result in the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, the promotion of tumor cell differentiation, and the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. Atypical PKCiota, a serine\u002Fthreonine kinase overexpressed in numerous cancer cell types, plays an important role in cancer proliferation, invasion, and survival; Par6 is a scaffold protein that facilitates atypical PKC-mediated phosphorylation of cytoplasmic proteins involved in epithelial and neuronal cell polarization.",fdaUniiCode:"E4768ZY6GM",identifier:"C74037",preferredName:b,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C2089"],synonyms:["Aurolate","Aurothiomalate Disodium","GOLD SODIUM THIOMALATE",b,"Myochrysine"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FGold_Sodium_Thiomalate",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Gold_Sodium_Thiomalate","Gold Sodium Thiomalate","2021-10-30T13:44:16.943Z")));
