Upon administration, dalpiciclib selectively inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and 6 (CDK6). This inhibits retinoblastoma (Rb) protein phosphorylation early in the G1 phase, which prevents CDK-mediated G1-S phase transition and leads to cell cycle arrest. This suppresses DNA replication and decreases tumor cell proliferation. CDK4 and 6 are serine\u002Fthreonine kinases that are upregulated in many tumor cell types and play a key role in the regulation of cell cycle progression.",fdaUniiCode:"5ZHA5P4PFX",identifier:"C125899",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C2185"],synonyms:["CDK4\u002F6 Inhibitor SHR6390","DALPICICLIB",a,"SHR-6390","SHR6390"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FDalpiciclib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Dalpiciclib","","2021-10-30T13:30:38.013Z")));
