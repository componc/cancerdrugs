Upon administration, reparixin allosterically binds to CXCR1 and prevents CXCR1 activation by its ligand interleukin 8 (IL-8 or CXCL8). This may cause cancer stem cell (CSC) apoptosis and may inhibit tumor cell progression and metastasis. CXCR1, overexpressed on CSCs, plays a key role in CSC survival and the ability of CSC to self-renew; it is also linked to tumor resistance to chemotherapy. Inhibition of the IL-8\u002FCXCR1 interaction also potentiates the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapeutic agents. In addition, reparixin inhibits CXCR2 activation and may reduce both neutrophil recruitment and vascular permeability during inflammation or injury.",fdaUniiCode:"U604E1NB3K",identifier:"C66515",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C63817"],synonyms:["2-(4-Isobutylphenyl)propionylmethanesulfonamide","Benzeneacetamide, Alpha-methyl-4-(2-methylpropyl)-N- (methylsulfonyl)- (alphaR)-","DF 1681Y","REPARIXIN",a,"Repertaxin"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FReparixin",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Reparixin","2021-10-30T13:42:55.743Z")));
