Individual RCC-specific RNA, encoding a unique repertoire of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) (including telomerase reverse transcriptase, G250, and oncofetal antigen) is electroporated into autologous dendritic cells (DCs), transfected with synthetic RNA that encodes a truncated version of the T-cell protein CD40L; the transfected autologous DCs express and process both patient-specific RCC TAAs and the truncated CD40L protein. When reintroduced back to the patient, rocapuldencel-T may elicit a highly specific cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) response against RCC cells expressing the patient-specific RCC TAA repertoire. The signal cascade initiated by stimulation of the truncated, ectopically expressed co-stimulatory molecule CD40L results in the secretion of the inflammatory cytokine IL-12 downstream.",fdaUniiCode:"8I9S6401XZ",identifier:"C77907",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C28310"],synonyms:["AGS-003","CMN-001","ROCAPULDENCEL-T",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FRocapuldencel-T",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Rocapuldencel-T","","2021-10-30T13:45:00.683Z")));
