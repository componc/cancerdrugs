Carlumab binds to and inhibits CLL2, which may result in inhibition of angiogenesis and, so, tumor cell proliferation. Endothelium-derived CLL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein; MCP1) is a member of the beta-chemokine family, can stimulate monocyte\u002Fmacrophage migration and smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, and plays a role in angiogenesis and tumor cell migration; CCL2 induction of angiogenesis may involve the upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) gene expression which, in turn, induces vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) gene expression.",fdaUniiCode:"6TC1BB2EV9",identifier:"C71010",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:["Anti-human Small-inducible Cytokine A2 Monoclonal Antibody CNTO 888","CARLUMAB","CNTO 888",a,"Immunoglobulin G1, anti-(human monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) (human monoclonal CNTO888 gamma 1-chain), disulfide with human monoclonal CNTO888 kappa-chain, dimer"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FCarlumab",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Carlumab","2021-10-30T13:43:32.593Z")));
