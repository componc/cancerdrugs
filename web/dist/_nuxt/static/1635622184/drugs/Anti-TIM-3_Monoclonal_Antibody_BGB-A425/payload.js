Upon administration, BGB-A425 binds to TIM-3 expressed on certain T-cells, including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), thereby preventing the engagement of TIM-3 by its ligands, phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) and galectin-9. This abrogates T-cell inhibition, activates antigen-specific T-lymphocytes and enhances cytotoxic T-cell-mediated tumor cell lysis, which results in a reduction in tumor cell proliferation. TIM-3, a transmembrane protein and immune checkpoint receptor, is associated with tumor-mediated immune suppression.",fdaUniiCode:"53YMC3A1CU",identifier:"C157242",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C141146"],synonyms:[c,"BGB A425","BGB-A425","BGBA425"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-TIM-3_Monoclonal_Antibody_BGB-A425",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-TIM-3_Monoclonal_Antibody_BGB-A425","Anti-TIM-3 Monoclonal Antibody BGB-A425","2021-10-30T13:34:35.873Z")));
