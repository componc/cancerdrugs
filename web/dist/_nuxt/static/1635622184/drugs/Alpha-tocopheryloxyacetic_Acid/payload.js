Upon administration, alpha-tocopheryloxyacetic acid (alpha-TEA) induces tumor autophagy; the autophagosomes formed, which carry tumor associated antigens (TAAs), allow for increased cross-presentation of TAAs by professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This activates a T cell-mediated T helper type 1 (TH1) response, generates a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against cancer cells, and reduces the frequency of regulatory T-cell (Treg) differentiation. In addition, alpha-TEA modulates the release of various cytokines and chemokines and induces tumor cell apoptosis. Altogether, this results in decreased tumor cell proliferation.",fdaUniiCode:"JW7FJR3ZLY",identifier:"C117234",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129820"],synonyms:[".ALPHA.-TOCOPHERYLOXYACETIC ACID","2,5,7,8-Tetramethyl-(2R-(4R,8R,12-trimethyltridecyl) chroman-6-yloxy) Acetic Acid",c,"a-TEA","alpha-TEA"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAlpha-tocopheryloxyacetic_Acid",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Alpha-tocopheryloxyacetic_Acid","Alpha-tocopheryloxyacetic Acid","2021-10-30T13:19:24.943Z")));
