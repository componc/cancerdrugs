Upon specific, high-affinity binding to IL-4 receptors located on the tumor cell surface., IL4-Pseudomonas exotoxin fusion protein MDNA55 is internalized; the exotoxin moiety then binds to translation elongation factor 2 (EF-2), which may result in ADP ribosylation, deactivation of EF-2, inhibition of protein synthesis, and tumor cell apoptosis. The Pseudomonas exotoxin moiety of this agent has been engineered to reduce non-specific binding to cells expressing its receptor, the multiligand cell surface receptor alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor\u002Flow-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (alpha 2MR\u002FLRP).
