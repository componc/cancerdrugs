Mavelertinib specifically binds to and inhibits EGFR T790M, a secondary acquired resistance mutation, which prevents EGFR-mediated signaling and leads to cell death in EGFR\u002FT790M-expressing tumor cells. Compared to some other EGFR inhibitors, PF-06747775 may have therapeutic benefits in tumors with T790M-mediated drug resistance. This agent shows minimal activity against wild-type EGFR (WT EGFR), and does not cause dose-limiting toxicities that occur during the use of non-selective EGFR inhibitors, which can inhibit WT EGFR. EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase mutated in many tumor cell types, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization.",fdaUniiCode:"YXX2180047",identifier:"C120307",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C2167"],synonyms:["2-Propenamide, N-((3R,4R)-4-fluoro-1-(6-((3-methoxy-1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)amino)-9-methyl-9H-purin-2-yl)-3-pyrrolidinyl)-","MAVELERTINIB",a,"PF-06747775"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FMavelertinib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Mavelertinib","","2021-10-30T13:20:01.413Z")));
