Upon administration, tilvestamab targets, binds to and inhibits the activity of AXL, which is expressed on the surfaces of a variety of cancer cell types. This prevents AXL-mediated signaling, and may inhibit tumor cell proliferation, migration and invasion. AXL, a member of the TAM (TYRO3, AXL and MER) family of receptor tyrosine kinases, is overexpressed by many tumor cell types, and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation, survival, invasion and metastasis; its expression is associated with drug resistance, tumor immune evasion and poor prognosis.",fdaUniiCode:"IZK2TH7X5M",identifier:"C175866",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129822"],synonyms:["BGB 149","BGB-149","BGB149","TILVESTAMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTilvestamab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Tilvestamab","","2021-10-30T13:36:27.003Z")));
