Duvortuxizumab possesses two antigen-recognition and binding sites, one for the CD3 complex, a group of T-cell surface glycoproteins that complex with the T-cell receptor (TCR), and one for CD19, a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) overexpressed on the surface of B-cells. Upon administration, duvortuxizumab binds to CD3-expressing T-cells and CD19-expressing cancer cells, thereby crosslinking CD19-expressing tumor B-cells and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). This may result in a potent CTL-mediated cell lysis of CD19-expressing B-lymphocytes. CD19, a B-cell specific membrane antigen, is expressed during normal B-cell development and on B-cell malignancies.",fdaUniiCode:"J545GSE96Y",identifier:"C122406",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Immunologic Factor",subclassOf:["C20401"],synonyms:["CD19 x CD3 DART Protein JNJ-64052781","DUVORTUXIZUMAB",a,"JNJ-64052781","MGD011","RES192M1.2","hBU12(2.4)-hXR32-MP3 M1.2"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FDuvortuxizumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Duvortuxizumab","","2021-10-30T13:29:56.373Z")));
