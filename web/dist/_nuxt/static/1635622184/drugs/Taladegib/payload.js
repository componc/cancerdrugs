Taladegib inhibits signaling that is mediated by the Hh pathway protein Smo, which may result in a suppression of the Hh signaling pathway and may lead to the inhibition of the proliferation of tumor cells in which this pathway is abnormally activated. The Hh signaling pathway plays an important role in cellular growth, differentiation and repair; constitutive activation of this pathway is associated with uncontrolled cellular proliferation and has been observed in a variety of cancers.",fdaUniiCode:"QY8BWX1LJ5",identifier:"C103826",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C2189"],synonyms:["4-Fluoro-N-methyl-N-(1-(4-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)phthalazin-1-yl)piperidin-4-yl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzamide","Benzamide, 4-Fluoro-N-methyl-N-(1-(4-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)-1-phthalazinyl)-4-piperidinyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)-","LY-2940680","LY2940680","TALADEGIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTaladegib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Taladegib","","2021-10-30T13:17:28.593Z")));
