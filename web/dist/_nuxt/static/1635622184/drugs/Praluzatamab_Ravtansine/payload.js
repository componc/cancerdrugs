Upon administration of praluzatamab ravtansine and migration to the tumor microenvironment (TME), the cleavable masking peptide, which prevent anti-CD166 antibody binding to the CD166 expressed on both normal cells and tumor cells, is proteolytically cleaved by tumor-associated proteases that are specifically present in the TME. This enables the anti-CD166 antibody moiety of CX-2009 to selectively bind to, be internalized by, and deliver DM4 into CD166-expressing tumor cells. Following internalization, DM4 is released, binds to tubulin and disrupts microtubule assembly\u002Fdisassembly dynamics, resulting in inhibition of cell division and cell growth of CD166-expressing tumor cells. The masking peptide prevents binding of the anti-CD166 antibody to CD166 in normal tissues, thereby minimizing toxicities.",fdaUniiCode:"RD2I59M9FC",identifier:"C134697",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129823"],synonyms:["ADC CX-2009","Anti-CD166-DM4 CX-2009","CX-2009","PDC CX-2009","PRALUZATAMAB RAVTANSINE",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FPraluzatamab_Ravtansine",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Praluzatamab_Ravtansine","","Praluzatamab Ravtansine","2021-10-30T13:31:50.323Z")));
