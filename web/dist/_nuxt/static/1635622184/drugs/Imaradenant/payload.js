Upon administration, imaradenant selectively binds to and inhibits A2AR expressed on T-lymphocytes. This blocks tumor-released adenosine from interacting with A2AR and prevents the adenosine\u002FA2AR-mediated inhibition of T-lymphocytes. This results in the proliferation and activation of T-lymphocytes, and stimulates a T-cell-mediated immune response against tumor cells. A2AR, a G protein-coupled receptor, is highly expressed on the cell surfaces of T-cells and, upon activation by adenosine, inhibits T-cell proliferation and activation. Adenosine is often overproduced by cancer cells and plays a key role in immunosuppression.",fdaUniiCode:"770140J08A",identifier:"C148039",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C2139"],synonyms:["A2AR Antagonist AZD4635","AZD-4635","AZD4635","Adenosine A2A Receptor Antagonist AZD4635","HTL-1071","IMARADENANT",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FImaradenant",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Imaradenant","","2021-10-30T13:33:06.143Z")));
