Upon administration, the antibody moiety of anti-B7-H3 ADC MGC018 specifically targets and binds to the cell surface antigen B7-H3, leading to internalization of the ADC by the tumor cell. The linker is cleaved inside the tumor cell by proteases at the dipeptide valine-citrulline (vc), thereby releasing the duocarmycin payload. Duocarmycin binds to the minor groove of DNA, alkylates adenine at the N3 position, and induces cell death. B7-H3, a type I transmembrane protein and a member of the B7 co-stimulatory protein superfamily, is overexpressed on certain tumor cell types and on various immune cells but is minimally expressed by normal human tissues. B7-H3 is a negative regulator of T-cell activation and its overexpression plays a key role in immuno-evasion, tumor cell invasion and metastasis, and its expression is correlated with poor prognosis.",fdaUniiCode:"2ZK3D69DQJ",identifier:"C159495",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129823","C1512"],synonyms:["Anti-B7H3 ADC",c,"MG-C018","MGC 018","MGC-018","MGC018"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-B7H3_Antibody-drug_Conjugate_MGC018",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-B7H3_Antibody-drug_Conjugate_MGC018","Anti-B7H3 Antibody-drug Conjugate MGC018","2021-10-30T13:34:53.933Z")));
