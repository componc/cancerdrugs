INNO-406 specifically binds to and inhibits the Bcr\u002FAbl fusion protein tyrosine kinase, an abnormal enzyme produced by Philadelphia chromosomal translocation associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Furthermore, this agent also inhibits the Src-family member Lyn tyrosine kinase, upregulated in imatinib-resistant CML cells and in a variety of solid cancer cell types. The inhibitory effect of INNO-406 on these specific tyrosine kinases decreases cellular proliferation and induces apoptosis. A high percentage of CML patients are refractory to imatinib, which sometimes results from point mutations occurring in the kinase domain of the Bcr\u002FAbl fusion product. Due to its dual inhibitory activity, INNO-406 has been shown to overcome this particular drug resistance and to be a potent and effective agent in the treatment of imatinib-resistant CML.",fdaUniiCode:"NVW4Z03I9B",identifier:"C62516",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C1967"],synonyms:["BAFETINIB",a,"Benzamide, N-[3-([4,5'-bipyrimidin]-2-ylamino)-4-methylphenyl]-4-[[(3S)-3- (dimethylamino)-1-pyrrolidinyl]methyl]-3-(trifluoromethyl)-","CNS-9","Dual Bcr-Abl\u002FLyn Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor INNO-406","INNO-406","NS-187"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FBafetinib",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Bafetinib","2021-10-30T13:42:10.023Z")));
