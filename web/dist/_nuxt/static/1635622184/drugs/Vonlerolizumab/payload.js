Upon intravenous administration, vonlerolizumab selectively binds to and activates OX40, by mimicking the action of endogenous OX40 ligand (OX40L). OX40 activation induces proliferation of effector T-lymphocytes and inhibits the activity of regulatory T-cells. In the presence of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), this may promote an immune response against the TAA-expressing tumor cells. OX40, a cell surface glycoprotein and member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily, is expressed on T-lymphocytes and provides a co-stimulatory signal for the proliferation and survival of activated T-cells.",fdaUniiCode:"C78148TF1D",identifier:"C121376",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C96040"],synonyms:["Anti-OX40 Monoclonal Antibody MOXR0916","MOXR0916","Pogalizumab","RG 7888","RG-7888","RG7888","RO7021608","VONLEROLIZUMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FVonlerolizumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Vonlerolizumab","","2021-10-30T13:20:08.543Z")));
