Upon administration of obrindatamab, the anti-B7-H3 component targets and binds to the cell surface antigen B7-H3; at the same time, the anti-CD3 component binds to human CD3. This cross-links the T-cells to B7-H3-expressing tumor cells, activates and redirects endogenous T-cells to kill B7-H3-expressing tumor cells, and inhibits proliferation of B7-H3-expressing tumor cells. B7-H3, a type I transmembrane protein and a member of the B7 co-stimulatory protein superfamily, is overexpressed on certain tumor cell types and on various immune cells but is minimally expressed by normal human tissues. B7-H3 is a negative regulator of T-cell activation and its overexpression plays a key role in immuno-evasion, tumor cell invasion and metastasis, and its expression is correlated with poor prognosis.",fdaUniiCode:"YE8XXF1SDZ",identifier:"C136983",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129820"],synonyms:["B7-H3 x CD3 DART Protein","B7-H3 x CD3 Dual-affinity Re-targeting Protein MGD009","DART Protein MGD009","Dual-affinity B7-H3\u002FCD3-targeted Protein MGD009","MGD 009","MGD-009","MGD009","OBRINDATAMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FObrindatamab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Obrindatamab","","2021-10-30T13:31:59.553Z")));
