Upon administration, zeluvalimab targets, binds to and inhibits PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore immune function through the activation of T-cells and T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. PD-1, a transmembrane protein in the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) expressed on T-cells, functions as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands, programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; B7-H1; CD274) and 2 (PD-L2); it plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.",fdaUniiCode:"DX474PAV6P",identifier:"C161597",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C128037","C129822"],synonyms:["AMG 404","AMG-404","AMG404","Anti-PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody AMG 404","ZELUVALIMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FZeluvalimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Zeluvalimab","","2021-10-30T13:35:15.473Z")));
