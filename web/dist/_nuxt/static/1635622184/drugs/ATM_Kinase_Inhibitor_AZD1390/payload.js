Upon oral administration, AZD1390 targets and binds to ATM, thereby inhibiting the kinase activity of ATM and ATM-mediated signaling. This prevents DNA damage checkpoint activation, disrupts DNA damage repair, induces tumor cell apoptosis, and leads to cell death in ATM-overexpressing tumor cells. AZD1390 hypersensitizes tumors to chemo\u002Fradiotherapy. In addition, AZD1390 is able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). ATM, a serine\u002Fthreonine protein kinase belonging to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family of protein kinases, is upregulated in a variety of cancer cell types. It is activated in response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) and plays a key role in DNA repair.",fdaUniiCode:"CI43QFE22O",identifier:"C150167",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C61074"],synonyms:["7-Fluoro-1-isopropyl-3-methyl-8-(6-(3-(piperidin-1-yl)propoxy)pyridin-3-yl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-2(3H)-one",c,"AZD-1390","AZD1390"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FATM_Kinase_Inhibitor_AZD1390",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("ATM_Kinase_Inhibitor_AZD1390","","ATM Kinase Inhibitor AZD1390","2021-10-30T13:33:20.573Z")));
