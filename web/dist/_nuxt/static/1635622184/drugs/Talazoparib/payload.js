Talazoparib selectively binds to PARP and prevents PARP-mediated DNA repair of single strand DNA breaks via the base-excision repair pathway. This enhances the accumulation of DNA strand breaks, promotes genomic instability and eventually leads to apoptosis. PARP catalyzes post-translational ADP-ribosylation of nuclear proteins that signal and recruit other proteins to repair damaged DNA and is activated by single-strand DNA breaks.",fdaUniiCode:"9QHX048FRV",identifier:"C95733",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C62554"],synonyms:["BMN 673","BMN-673","TALAZOPARIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTalazoparib",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Talazoparib","talazoparib","","2021-10-30T13:48:08.813Z")));
