Upon intravenous administration, vadacabtagene leraleucel,is directed to CD19-expressing tumor cells, and, upon binding to the T-cells, induce selective toxicity in CD19-expressing tumor cells. CD19 antigen is a B-cell specific cell surface antigen expressed in all B-cell lineage malignancies. The CD28 co-stimulatory molecule signaling domain enhances activation and signaling after recognition of CD19. The inclusion of the CD28 signaling domain may increase proliferation of T-cells and antitumor activity compared to the inclusion of the CD3-zeta chain alone.",fdaUniiCode:"A4O2H9W17Y",identifier:"C133718",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Cell",subclassOf:["C129826","C137999","C28681"],synonyms:["Anti-CD19\u002FCD28\u002Fzeta Modified CAR CD3+ T Lymphocytes JCAR015","JCAR 015","JCAR 15","JCAR015","VADACABTAGENE LERALEUCEL",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FVadacabtagene_Leraleucel",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Vadacabtagene_Leraleucel","Vadacabtagene Leraleucel","2021-10-30T13:31:45.823Z")));
