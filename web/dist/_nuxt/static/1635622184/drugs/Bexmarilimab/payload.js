Upon administration, bexmarilimab targets and binds to CLEVER-1 that is expressed on tumor endothelial cells. This prevents the recruitment, infiltration and attachment of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) at the tumor site. By preventing the binding of TAMs to tumor cells, the infiltration of activated T-regulatory cells (Tregs) to the tumor and the TAM-mediated immune suppression is abrogated, leading to the polarization of TAM from the immunosuppressive M2 macrophages to the anti-inflammatory and immunostimulatory M1 macrophages. This leads to the activation of the immune system, resulting in a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response and inhibition of tumor cell growth and metastasis. CLEVER-1 is an endothelial cell surface molecule involved in immune suppression, cancer growth and metastasis.",fdaUniiCode:"SA0O2AK3LA",identifier:"C159536",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Immunologic Factor",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:["Anti-stabilin-1 Monoclonal Antibody FP-1305","BEXMARILIMAB",a,"Clevegen","FP 1305","FP-1305","FP1305"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FBexmarilimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Bexmarilimab","","2021-10-30T13:34:54.883Z")));
