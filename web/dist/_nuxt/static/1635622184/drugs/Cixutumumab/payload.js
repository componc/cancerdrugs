Cixutumumab selectively binds to membrane-bound IGF-1R, thereby preventing the binding of the natural ligand IGF-1 and the subsequent activation of PI3K\u002FAKT signaling pathway. Downregulation of the PI3K\u002FAKT survival pathway may result in the induction of cancer cell apoptosis and may decrease cancer cellular proliferation. IGF-1R, a receptor tyrosine kinase of the insulin receptor superfamily overexpressed by many cancer cell types, stimulates cell proliferation, enables oncogenic transformation, and suppresses apoptosis; IGF-1R signaling has been implicated in tumorigenesis and metastasis.",fdaUniiCode:"2285XW22DR",identifier:"C79828",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:["Anti-IGF-1R Recombinant Monoclonal Antibody IMC-A12","CIXUTUMUMAB",a,"IMC-A12","cixutumumab"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FCixutumumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Cixutumumab","","2021-10-30T13:45:27.423Z")));
