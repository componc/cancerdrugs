Upon administration, favezelimab binds to LAG3 expressed on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and blocks its binding with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules expressed on tumor cells. This activates antigen-specific T-lymphocytes and enhances cytotoxic T-cell-mediated tumor cell lysis, which leads to a reduction in tumor growth. LAG3, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), is expressed on various immune cells, and negatively regulates both proliferation and activation of T-cells. Its expression on TILs is associated with tumor-mediated immune suppression.",fdaUniiCode:"H1396W7D1H",identifier:"C142077",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C134305"],synonyms:["Anti-LAG-3 Monoclonal Antibody MK-4280","Anti-LAG3 Monoclonal Antibody MK-4280","FAVEZELIMAB",a,"MK 4280","MK-4280","MK4280"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FFavezelimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Favezelimab","","2021-10-30T13:32:27.763Z")));
