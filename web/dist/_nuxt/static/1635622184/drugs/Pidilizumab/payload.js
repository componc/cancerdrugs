Pidilizumab blocks interaction between the receptor PD-1 with its ligands, PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-1L1) and PD-1 ligand 2 (PD-1L2), resulting in the attenuation of apoptotic processes in lymphocytes, primarily effector\u002Fmemory T cells, and the augmentation of the anti-tumor activities of NK cells. PD-1 is an inhibitory receptor belonging to the B7-receptor family that is expressed on lymphocytes and myeloid cells; its ligands, PD-1L1 and PD-1L2, are expressed not only by hematopoietic cells but also by cells in non-lymphoid tissues.",fdaUniiCode:"B932PAQ1BQ",identifier:"C71014",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C128037"],synonyms:["CT 011","CT-011","Immunoglobulin G1, Anti-(Human Programmed Cell Death 1); Humanized Mouse Monoclonal CT-011 Gamma1 Heavy Chain (220-213')-disulfide with Humanized Mouse Monoclonal CT-011 Kappa Light Chain Dimer (226-226'':229-229'')-bisdisulfide, Glycosylated (CT-011 is Expressed in NSO Cells)","MDV9300","PIDILIZUMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FPidilizumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Pidilizumab","","2021-10-30T13:43:33.493Z")));
