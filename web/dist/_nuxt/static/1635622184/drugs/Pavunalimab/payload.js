Upon administration, pavunalimab targets and binds to both CTLA-4 and LAG-3 expressed on T-cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Both CTLA-4 and LAG-3 are inhibitory receptors and members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF); they are overexpressed by regulatory T-cells (Tregs) in the TME where they downregulate T-cell activation and proliferation. Dual checkpoint blockade of CTLA-4 and LAG-3 with XmAb22841 may enhance T-cell activation and proliferation more than the blockade of either immune checkpoint receptor alone. The engineered Fc domain increases the stability and half-life of the antibody.",fdaUniiCode:"3PT70X17VS",identifier:"C159530",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C128036","C129822","C28227"],synonyms:["Anti-CTLA-4\u002FAnti-LAG-3 Bispecific Monoclonal Antibody XmAb22841","Anti-CTLA-4\u002FLAG-3 Bispecific Antibody XmAb22841","CTLA-4  x LAG-3 Bispecific Antibody XmAb22841","PAVUNALIMAB",a,"XmAb 22841","XmAb-22841","XmAb22841"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FPavunalimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Pavunalimab","","2021-10-30T13:34:54.393Z")));
