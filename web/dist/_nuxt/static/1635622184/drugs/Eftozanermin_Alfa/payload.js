Upon administration of eftozanermin alfa, this fusion protein binds to TRAIL-receptors, pro-apoptotic death receptors (DRs) TRAIL-R1 (death receptor 4; DR4) and TRAIL-R2 (death receptor 5; DR5), expressed on tumor cells, thereby inducing tumor cell apoptosis.  ABBV-621 is designed to maximize receptor clustering for optimal efficacy. TRAIL, a member of the TNF superfamily of cytokines, plays a key role in the induction of apoptosis through TRAIL-mediated death receptor pathways.",fdaUniiCode:"Q1K9TTP1WS",identifier:"C146854",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129839"],synonyms:["ABBV 621","ABBV-621","ABBV621","APG880","EFTOZANERMIN ALFA",c,"HERA Ligand ABBV-621","Hexavalent TRAIL Receptor Agonist ABBV-621","TRAIL Receptor Agonist ABBV-621","TRAIL-Fc Protein ABBV-621","TRAIL-receptor Agonist Fusion Protein ABBV-621"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FEftozanermin_Alfa",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Eftozanermin_Alfa","","Eftozanermin Alfa","2021-10-30T13:32:48.043Z")));
