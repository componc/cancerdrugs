Upon administration, tilsotolimod binds to and activates TLR9 expressed by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and B-cells. This initiates immune signaling pathways, activates B-cells and pDCs, and induces a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against tumor cells. TLR9 is a member of the TLR family, which plays a fundamental role in pathogen recognition and activation of innate immunity.",fdaUniiCode:"I6CNU8SY0F",identifier:"C125080",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C177175"],synonyms:["IMO 2125","IMO-2125","TILSOTOLIMOD SODIUM","TLR9 Agonist IMO-2125",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTilsotolimod_Sodium",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Tilsotolimod_Sodium","Tilsotolimod Sodium","2021-10-30T13:30:28.753Z")));
