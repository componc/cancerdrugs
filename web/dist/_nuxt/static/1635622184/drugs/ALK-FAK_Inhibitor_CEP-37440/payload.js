Upon administration, ALK-FAK inhibitor CEP-37440 selectively binds to and inhibits ALK kinase and FAK kinase. The inhibition leads to disruption of ALK- and FAK-mediated signal transduction pathways and eventually inhibits tumor cell growth in ALK- and FAK-overexpressing tumor cells. ALK belongs to the insulin receptor superfamily and plays an important role in nervous system development; its dysregulation and gene rearrangements are associated with a variety of tumors. The cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase FAK, a signal transducer for integrins, is upregulated and constitutively activated in various tumor types; it plays a key role in tumor cell migration, proliferation, survival, and tumor angiogenesis.",fdaUniiCode:"O3MNS8782H",identifier:"C111685",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C141136"],synonyms:[c,"CEP-37440"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FALK-FAK_Inhibitor_CEP-37440",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","ALK-FAK_Inhibitor_CEP-37440","ALK-FAK Inhibitor CEP-37440","2021-10-30T13:18:20.053Z")));
