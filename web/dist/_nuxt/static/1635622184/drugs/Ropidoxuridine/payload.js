Upon oral administration, ropidoxuridine (IPdR) is efficiently converted to idoxuridine (IUdR) by a hepatic aldehyde oxidase. In turn, IUdR is incorporated into DNA during replication, thereby sensitizing cells to ionizing radiation by increasing DNA strand breaks. Compared to IUdR, ropidoxuridine is associated with a lower toxicity profile and improved anti-tumor activity.",fdaUniiCode:"3HX21A3SQF",identifier:"C48813",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C1557","C798"],synonyms:["2(1H)-Pyrimidinone, 1-(2-deoxy-beta-D-erythro-pentofuranosyl)-5-iodo-","5-Iodo-2-pyrimidinone 2' deoxyribonucleoside","5-Iodo-2-pyrimidinone-2'-deoxyribose","IPdR","ROPIDOXURIDINE",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FRopidoxuridine",extension:".json",createdAt:"2021-10-30T13:40:20.463Z",updatedAt:"2021-10-30T13:40:20.473Z"}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Ropidoxuridine")));
