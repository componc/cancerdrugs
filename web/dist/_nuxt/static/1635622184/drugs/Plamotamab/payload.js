Plamotamab contains two antigen-recognition sites: one for human CD3, a T cell surface antigen, and one for human CD20, a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) that is exclusively expressed on B-cells during most stages of B-cell development and is often overexpressed in B-cell malignancies. Upon administration, plamotamab binds to both T-cells and CD20-expressing B-lineage tumor cells. The resulting cross-linkage may trigger a potent cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against the CD20-expressing tumor B-cells. Inclusion of an Fc domain on the antibody prolongs the half-life of the bispecific antibody and enhances T-cell-mediated tumor cell killing because the agent is able to bind to Fc receptors.",fdaUniiCode:"5ENX424FNF",identifier:"C130050",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C141215","C28227"],synonyms:["PLAMOTAMAB",a,"XmAb13676"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FPlamotamab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Plamotamab","","2021-10-30T13:31:18.823Z")));
