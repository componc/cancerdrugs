Upon administration, alofanib targets, allosterically binds to the extracellular domain of FGFR2 and inhibits the activity of FGFR2, which may result in the inhibition of basic FGF (bFGF)\u002FFGFR2-related signal transduction pathways. This inhibits FGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation and migration, and inhibits the proliferation of FGFR2-overexpressing tumor cells.
