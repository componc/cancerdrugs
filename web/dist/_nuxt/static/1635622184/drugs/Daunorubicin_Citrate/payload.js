Daunorubicin citrate intercalates DNA, which leads to inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis, and consequently blocks cell division and results in apoptosis. This anti-tumor antibiotic is most active in the S phase of cell division. Daunorubicin is indicated in the treatment of a wide variety of cancers including acute non-lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphomas, Ewing's sarcoma, Wilms' tumor, and chronic myelocytic leukemia.
