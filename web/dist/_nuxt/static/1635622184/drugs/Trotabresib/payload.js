Upon oral administration, trotabresib preferentially binds to the second bromodomain (BD2) of BET proteins, thereby preventing the interaction between the BET proteins and acetylated histones. This disrupts chromatin remodeling and gene expression. Prevention of the expression of certain growth-promoting genes may lead to an inhibition of proliferation in BET-overexpressing tumor cells. BET proteins (BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDT) are transcriptional regulators that contain two homologous bromodomains, the BD1 and BD2 domains. They play an important role during development and cellular growth.",fdaUniiCode:"K424WH3WU0",identifier:"C151951",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C128462"],synonyms:["4-(2-(Cyclopropylmethoxy)-5-methylsulfonylphenyl)-2-methylisoquinolin-1-one","BET Inhibitor CC-90010","CC 90010","CC-90010","CC90010","TROTABRESIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTrotabresib",extension:".json",createdAt:"2021-10-30T13:33:30.483Z",updatedAt:"2021-10-30T13:33:30.493Z"}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Trotabresib","")));
