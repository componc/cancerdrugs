Upon administration of anti-FLT3\u002FCD3 BiTE antibody AMG 427, this bispecific antibody binds to both CD3 on cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) and FLT3 found on FLT3-expressing tumor cells. This activates and redirects CTLs to FLT3-expressing tumor cells, which results in the CTL-mediated cell death of FLT3-expressing tumor cells. FLT3, a cytokine receptor belonging to the class III tyrosine kinase receptors, is overexpressed or mutated in most B-lineage and acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs).",fdaUniiCode:"P9I9Z3MF7Z",identifier:"C156399",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C163790","C28227"],synonyms:["AMG 427","AMG-427","AMG427","Anti-FLT3 x Anti-CD3 BiTE AMG 427",c,"BiTE Antibody AMG 427","Bispecific T-cell Engager Antibody AMG 427","FLT3\u002FCD3-directed Bispecific T-cell Engager Antibody AMG 427"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-FLT3CD3_BiTE_Antibody_AMG_427",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-FLT3CD3_BiTE_Antibody_AMG_427","Anti-FLT3\u002FCD3 BiTE Antibody AMG 427","2021-10-30T13:34:21.993Z")));
