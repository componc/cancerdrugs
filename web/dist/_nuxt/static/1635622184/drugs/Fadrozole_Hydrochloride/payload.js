Fadrozole specifically inhibits aromatase, blocking the aromatization of androstenedione and testosterone into estrone and estradiol, respectively, the final step in estrogen biosynthesis; the reduction in estrogen levels may inhibit growth in estrogen-dependent cancers. Aromatase, a member of the cytochrome P-450 superfamily, is found in many tissues; overexpression has been linked to the development of preneoplastic and neoplastic changes in breast tissue.",fdaUniiCode:"H0Q44H4ECQ",identifier:"C1044",preferredName:b,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C2018"],synonyms:["4-(5,6,7,8-Tetrahydroimidazo(1,5-a)pyridin-5-yl)benzonitrile Hydrochloride","4-(5,6,7,8-Tetrahydroimidazo[1,5-a]pyridin-5-yl)benzonitrile Monohydrochloride","Afema","Arensin","CGS-16949A","FADROZOLE HYDROCHLORIDE",b]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FFadrozole_Hydrochloride",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Fadrozole_Hydrochloride","Fadrozole Hydrochloride","2021-10-30T13:17:35.503Z")));
