Upifitamab rilsodotin is produced via the proprietary dolaflexin ADC conjugation platform, which promotes the conjugation of between 10 and 15 AF-HPA payload molecules to each XMT-1535 antibody. Upon administration of upifitamab rilsodotin, the antibody moiety targets and binds to NaPi2b expressed on tumor cells. Upon binding, internalization by endosomes\u002Flysosomes, and enzymatic cleavage, the AF-HPA binds to tubulin and inhibits microtubule polymerization, which results in G2\u002FM phase arrest and apoptosis of NaPi2b-expressing tumor cells. NaPi2b, a tumor-associated antigen (TAA), is overexpressed on a variety of cancer cells and plays a key role in the transport of inorganic phosphate (Pi) and the maintenance of phosphate homeostasis.",fdaUniiCode:"Q4MDA7821L",identifier:"C147577",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129823","C1512"],synonyms:["ADC XMT-1536","Anti-NaPi2b ADC XMT-1536","Anti-NaPi2b\u002FAuristatin F-HPA ADC XMT-1536","UPIFITAMAB RILSODOTIN",c,"XMT 1536","XMT-1536","XMT1536"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FUpifitamab_Rilsodotin",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Upifitamab_Rilsodotin","Upifitamab Rilsodotin","2021-10-30T13:32:53.473Z")));
