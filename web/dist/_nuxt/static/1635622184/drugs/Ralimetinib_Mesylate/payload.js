Upon administration, ralimetinib inhibits the activity of p38, particularly the alpha and beta isoforms, thereby inhibiting MAPKAPK2 phosphorylation and preventing p38 MAPK-mediated signaling. This may inhibit the production of a variety of cytokines involved in inflammation, cellular proliferation and angiogenesis such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), interleukin (IL)-1, -6 and -8, vascular endothelial growth factor, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha. Ultimately this induces apoptosis and reduces tumor cell proliferation. In addition, inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway by LY2228820 increases the antineoplastic activity of certain chemotherapeutic agents. p38 MAPK, a serine\u002Fthreonine protein kinase that is often upregulated in cancer cells, plays a crucial role in tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis.",fdaUniiCode:"QUW7B71FO9",identifier:"C105853",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C61074"],synonyms:["3H-Imidazo(4,5-b)pyridin-2-amine, 5-(2-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-1H-imidazol-5-yl)-3-(2,2-dimethylpropyl)-, Methanesulfonate (1:2)","LY-2228820","LY2228820","LY2228820 Dimesylate","RALIMETINIB MESYLATE","Ralimetinib Dimesylate",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FRalimetinib_Mesylate",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Ralimetinib_Mesylate","","Ralimetinib Mesylate","2021-10-30T13:17:49.903Z")));
