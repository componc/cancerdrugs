Upon administration, oleclumab targets and binds to CD73, leading to clustering of and internalization of CD73. This prevents CD73-mediated conversion of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine and decreases the amount of free adenosine. This prevents adenosine-mediated lymphocyte suppression and increases the activity of CD8-positive effector cells. This also activates macrophages, and reduces both myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T-lymphocytes. By abrogating the inhibitory effect on the immune system and enhancing the cytotoxic T-cell-mediated immune response against cancer cells, tumor cell growth decreases. In addition, clustering and internalization of CD73 decreases the migration of cancer cells and prevents metastasis. CD73, a plasma membrane protein upregulated on a number of cancer cell types, catalyzes the conversion of extracellular nucleotides, such as AMP, to membrane-permeable nucleosides, such as adenosine; it plays a key role in adenosine-mediated immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment.",fdaUniiCode:"5CRY01URYQ",identifier:"C123914",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:["Anti-CD73 Monoclonal Antibody MEDI9447","MEDI9447","OLECLUMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FOleclumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Oleclumab","","2021-10-30T13:30:11.463Z")));
