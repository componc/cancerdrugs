Upon intravenous administration, pimurutamab selectively targets and binds to the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), thereby preventing the activation and subsequent dimerization of the receptor. This may prevent EGFR-mediated signaling and inhibit EGFR-dependent tumor cell proliferation.  In addition, the glyco-optimization promotes antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). EGFR, a member of the epidermal growth factor family of extracellular protein ligands, may be overexpressed on the cell surfaces of certain tumor types.",fdaUniiCode:"5V1Y8T4RB6",identifier:"C163981",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C133878"],synonyms:["Anti-EGFR Monoclonal Antibody HLX-07","Cetuximab Biobetter HLX07","HLX 07","HLX-07","HLX07","PIMURUTAMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FPimurutamab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Pimurutamab","","2021-10-30T13:35:37.573Z")));
