Upon intravenous administration, thioureidobutyronitrile activates p53 which in turn induces the expressions of p21 and PUMA (p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis), thereby inhibiting cancer cell growth and causing tumor cell apoptosis. Thioureidobutyronitrile may be effective in drug-resistant cancers with mutated p53. p53 tumor suppressor, a transcription factor regulating the expression of many stress response genes and mediating various anti-proliferative processes, is often mutated in cancer cells.",fdaUniiCode:"C3059TG1KN",identifier:"C102881",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129839"],synonyms:["4-ISOTHIOUREIDOBUTYRONITRILE","4-Isothioureidobutyronitrile","Carbamimidothioic Acid, 3-Cyanopropyl Ester","Kevetrin",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FThioureidobutyronitrile",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Thioureidobutyronitrile","","2021-10-30T13:17:17.613Z")));
