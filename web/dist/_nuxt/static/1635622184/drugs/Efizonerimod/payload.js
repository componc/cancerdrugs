Upon administration, efizonerimod selectively binds to and activates the OX40 receptor, by mimicking the action of endogenous OX40 ligand (OX40L). OX40 receptor activation induces proliferation of memory and effector T lymphocytes. In the presence of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), this may promote an immune response against the TAA-expressing tumor cells. OX40, a cell surface glycoprotein and member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family, is expressed on T-lymphocytes and provides a co-stimulatory signal for the proliferation and survival of activated T cells.",fdaUniiCode:"1MH7C2X8KE",identifier:"C118282",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C96040"],synonyms:["EFIZONERIMOD",a,"Efizonerimod Alfa","Immunoglobulin G4 (10-proline) (Human Heavy Chain Fc Fragment) Fusion Protein with Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-associated Factor TRAF2 (Human C-C  Domain Fragment) Fusion Protein with CD252 Antigen (Human Extracellular Domain Fragment), Hexamer","MEDI6383"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FEfizonerimod",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Efizonerimod","","2021-10-30T13:19:38.633Z")));
