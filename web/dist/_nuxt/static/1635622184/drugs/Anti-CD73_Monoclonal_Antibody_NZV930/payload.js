Upon intravenous administration, anti-CD73 monoclonal antibody NZV930 targets and binds to CD73 on tumor cells, leading to internalization of CD73. This prevents CD73-mediated conversion of extracellular adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine, thereby preventing adenosine-mediated suppression of lymphocyte activity and increasing the activity of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). This also activates macrophages and reduces the activity of both myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T-lymphocytes. By abrogating the inhibitory effect on the immune system and enhancing the CTL-mediated immune response against cancer cells, tumor cell growth is decreased. CD73, a plasma membrane protein belonging to the 5'-nucleotidase (NTase) family, is upregulated in many cancer cell types and catalyzes the conversion of extracellular nucleotides, such as AMP, to membrane-permeable nucleosides, such as adenosine; it plays a key role in adenosine-mediated immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment.",fdaUniiCode:"2M0F9Q9SZ2",identifier:"C158132",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C176988"],synonyms:[c,"NZV 930","NZV-930","NZV930","SRF 373","SRF-373","SRF373"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-CD73_Monoclonal_Antibody_NZV930",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-CD73_Monoclonal_Antibody_NZV930","Anti-CD73 Monoclonal Antibody NZV930","2021-10-30T13:34:45.503Z")));
