Upon administration, erfonrilimab targets and binds to both PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells and CTLA-4 expressed on T-cells. This prevents the binding of PD-L1 to its receptor, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1, CD279), and inhibits the PD-1 and CTLA-4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation and proliferation. This restores immune function and activates a sustained cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against tumor cells. Both PD-L1, which is overexpressed in many human cancer cell types, and CTLA-4, an inhibitory T-cell receptor, play a role in the downregulation of the immune system and tumor evasion from host immunity.",fdaUniiCode:"9NP50O6YSA",identifier:"C157632",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C128036","C129822","C28227"],synonyms:["Anti-PD-L1 x CTLA-4 Bispecific Antibody KN046","Anti-PD-L1\u002FAnti-CTLA-4 Bispecific Antibody KN046","Anti-PD-L1\u002FCTLA-4 Bispecific Antibody KN046","ERFONRILIMAB",a,"KN 046","KN-046","KN046"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FErfonrilimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Erfonrilimab","","2021-10-30T13:34:42.383Z")));
