Anti-CPAA monoclonal antibody NPC-1C binds to CPAAs, which may activate the immune system to exert a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response and an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) response against CPAA-expressing tumor cells. CPAAs, cell surface proteins, are upregulated on colon and pancreatic tumor cells.
