Upon administration, anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody SHR-1210 binds to and blocks the binding of PD-1, expressed on activated T-lymphocytes, B-cells and natural killer (NK) cells, to its ligands programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2), which is primarily expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs). This prevents the activation of PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This restores immune function through the activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) and cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells or pathogens. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and plays a key role in tumor evasion from host immunity.",fdaUniiCode:"73096E137E",identifier:"C123816",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C128037","C129822"],synonyms:["AiRuiKa (TM)","CAMRELIZUMAB",a,"Carrizumab","HR-301210","SHR 1210","SHR-1210","SHR1210"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FCamrelizumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Camrelizumab","","2021-10-30T13:30:05.363Z")));
