Ipatasertib binds to and inhibits the activity of Akt in a non-ATP-competitive manner, which may result in the inhibition of the PI3K\u002FAkt signaling pathway and tumor cell proliferation and the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. Activation of the PI3K\u002FAkt signaling pathway is frequently associated with tumorigenesis and dysregulated PI3K\u002FAkt signaling may contribute to tumor resistance to a variety of antineoplastic agents.",fdaUniiCode:"524Y3IB4HQ",identifier:"C91072",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C155764"],synonyms:["(2S)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-((5r,7r)-7-hydroxy-5-methyl-6,7-dihydro-5h-cyclopenta(d)pyrimidin-4-yl)piperazin-1-yl(-3-((propan-2-yl)amino)propan-1-one","GDC-0068","IPATASERTIB",a,"RG-7440"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FIpatasertib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Ipatasertib","","2021-10-30T13:47:17.423Z")));
