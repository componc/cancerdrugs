Belapectin binds to the carbohydrate-binding domain of galectins, especially galectin-3, and may result in an induction of apoptosis mediated through activation of both mitochondria and caspases. This may reduce tumor growth in galectin-overexpressing tumor cells. Galectins, often overexpressed on tumor cells, play a key role in cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis, tumor angiogenesis and evasion of immune responses.",fdaUniiCode:"K7ODU55HT6",identifier:"C115111",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Nucleic Acid, Nucleoside, or Nucleotide",subclassOf:["C129839"],synonyms:["BELAPECTIN",a,"GR-MD-02","Galactoarabino-rhamnogalacturonate"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FBelapectin",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Belapectin","","2021-10-30T13:18:54.713Z")));
