Upon administration, CP-461 specifically binds to and blocks the activity of cyclic guanosine monophosphate-phosphodiesterase (cGMP-PDE), an enzyme that inhibits the normal apoptosis signal pathway. Inhibition of cGMP-PDE permits the apoptotic signal pathway to proceed unopposed, resulting in apoptotic cell death. cGMP-PDE is overexpressed in a variety of cancer cell types; therefore, CP-461 selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, with minimal or no effect in healthy cells.",fdaUniiCode:"68OJX9I7DT",identifier:"C133019",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129839","C744"],synonyms:["1H-Indene-3-acetamide, 5-Fluoro-2-methyl-N-(phenylmethyl)-1-(4-pyridinylmethylene)-, Monohydrochloride, (1Z)-","CEL 031","CP 461","CP-461","CP461","OSI 461",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FProapoptotic_Sulindac_Analog_CP-461",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Proapoptotic_Sulindac_Analog_CP-461","","Proapoptotic Sulindac Analog CP-461","2021-10-30T13:31:42.043Z")));
