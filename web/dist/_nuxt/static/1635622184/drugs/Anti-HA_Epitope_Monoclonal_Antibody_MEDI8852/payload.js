MEDI8852 was derived from an antibody isolated from human memory B-cells from patients previously infected with influenza caused by type A strains that was further optimized to increase neutralization potential. Upon infusion, MEDI8852 targets and binds to a region within the stalk of the HA protein that is highly conserved amongst all influenza A virus subtypes. This neutralizes and prevents essential steps of the viral lifecycle, thereby blocking infectivity of all influenza A virus subtypes. HA, a glycoprotein found on the surface of the influenza virus, plays a key role in viral attachment and cell entry.",fdaUniiCode:"OZS4TXB9VO",identifier:"C131295",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:[c,"Anti-Influenza A Hemagglutinin Epitope mAb MEDI8852","MEDI 8852","MEDI-8852","MEDI8852","pan-Influenza A mAb MEDI8852"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-HA_Epitope_Monoclonal_Antibody_MEDI8852",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-HA_Epitope_Monoclonal_Antibody_MEDI8852","Anti-HA Epitope Monoclonal Antibody MEDI8852","2021-10-30T13:31:23.013Z")));
