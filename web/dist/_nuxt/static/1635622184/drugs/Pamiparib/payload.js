Upon administration, pamiparib selectively binds to PARP and prevents PARP-mediated repair of single-strand DNA breaks via the base-excision repair (BER) pathway. This enhances the accumulation of DNA strand breaks, promotes genomic instability, and eventually leads to apoptosis. PARP is activated by single-strand DNA breaks and, subsequently, catalyzes post-translational ADP-ribosylation of nuclear proteins which then transduce signals to recruit other proteins to repair damaged DNA. Pamiparib may both potentiate the cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging agents and reverse tumor cell chemo- and radioresistance.",fdaUniiCode:"8375F9S90C",identifier:"C120553",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C62554"],synonyms:["5,6,7a,11-Tetraazacyclohepta(def)cyclopenta(a)fluoren-4(7H)-one, 2-Fluoro-5,8,9,10,10a,11-hexahydro-10a-methyl-, (10aR)-","BGB-290","PAMIPARIB","PARP Inhibitor BGB-290",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FPamiparib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Pamiparib","","2021-10-30T13:20:04.803Z")));
