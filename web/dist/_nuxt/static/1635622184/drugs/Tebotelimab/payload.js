Upon administration, tebotelimab specifically binds to both PD-1 and LAG-3, which are both expressed on T-cells. The dual blockade of the PD-1 and LAG-3 pathways enables potent activation of a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against tumor cells. PD-1 and LAG-3 play key roles in suppressing T-cell activation.",fdaUniiCode:"L62556GPXB",identifier:"C143957",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C124946","C308"],synonyms:["Anti-PD-1\u002FAnti-LAG-3 DART Protein MGD013","Bispecific DART Protein MGD013","Dual-affinity Retargeting Protein MGD013","MGD 013","MGD-013","MGD013","PD-1 x LAG-3 Bispecific DART Molecule MGD013","PD-1 x LAG-3 DART Molecule MGD013","PD-1 x LAG-3 DART Protein MGD013","TEBOTELIMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTebotelimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Tebotelimab","","2021-10-30T13:32:41.843Z")));
