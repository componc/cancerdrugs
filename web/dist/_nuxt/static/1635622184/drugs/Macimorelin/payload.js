Upon oral administration, macimorelin mimics endogenous ghrelin by stimulating appetite and binds to the growth hormone secretagogue receptor GHSR in the central nervous system, thereby mimicking the GH-releasing effects of ghrelin from the pituitary gland. Stimulation of GH secretion increases insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels which may further stimulate protein synthesis. In addition, ghrelin reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which may play a direct role in cancer-related loss of appetite.",fdaUniiCode:"8680B21W73",identifier:"C95123",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C76358"],synonyms:["AEZS-130","D-Tryptophanamide,2-methylalanyl-N-[(1R)-1-(formylamino)-2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]-","EP 1572","JMV 1843","MACIMORELIN",a,"Solorel"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FMacimorelin",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Macimorelin","2021-10-30T13:47:50.703Z")));
