Carboplatin contains a platinum atom complexed with two ammonia groups and a cyclobutane-dicarboxyl residue.  This agent is activated intracellularly to form reactive platinum complexes that bind to nucleophilic groups such as GC-rich sites in DNA, thereby inducing intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links, as well as DNA-protein cross-links.  These carboplatin-induced DNA and protein effects result in apoptosis and cell growth inhibition.  This agent possesses tumoricidal activity similar to that of its parent compound, cisplatin, but is more stable and less toxic.",fdaUniiCode:"BG3F62OND5",identifier:"C1282",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Inorganic Chemical",subclassOf:["C1450"],synonyms:["(SP-4-2)-diammine[1,1-cyclobutanedicarboxylato(2--)-O,O']platinum","1,1-cyclobutanedicarboxylic acid platinum complex","Blastocarb","CARBOPLATIN","CBDCA","Carboplat",a,"Carboplatin Hexal","Carboplatino","Carboplatinum","Carbosin","Carbosol","Carbotec","Cis-Diammine(cyclobutane-1,1-dicarboxylato)platinum","Displata","Ercar","JM-8","Nealorin","Novoplatinum","Paraplat","Paraplatin","Paraplatin AQ","Paraplatine","Platinwas","Ribocarbo","carboplatin","cis-diammine(1,1-cyclobutanedicarboxylato) platinum(II)","cis-diammine(cyclobutanedicarboxylato)platinum II","platinum, diammine(1,1-cyclobutanedicarboxylato(2-))-, (SP-4-2)"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FCarboplatin",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Carboplatin","INDICATIONS Initial Treatment of Advanced Ovarian Carcinoma Carboplatin injection is indicated for the initial treatment of advanced ovarian carcinoma in established combination with other approved chemotherapeutic agents. One established combination regimen consists of carboplatin and cyclophosphamide. Two randomized controlled studies conducted by the NCIC and SWOG with carboplatin versus cisplatin, both in combination with cyclophosphamide, have demonstrated equivalent overall survival between the two groups (see CLINICAL STUDIES ). There is limited statistical power to demonstrate equivalence in overall pathologic complete response rates and long-term survival (â‰¥ 3 years) because of the small number of patients with these outcomes: the small number of patients with residual tumor \u003C 2 cm after initial surgery also limits the statistical power to demonstrate equivalence in this subgroup. Secondary Treatment of Advanced Ovarian Carcinoma Carboplatin injection is indicated for the palliative treatment of patients with ovarian carcinoma recurrent after prior chemotherapy, including patients who have been previously treated with cisplatin. Within the group of patients previously treated with cisplatin, those who have developed progressive disease while receiving cisplatin therapy may have a decreased response rate.","2021-10-30T13:31:04.743Z")));
