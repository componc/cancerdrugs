Upon intravenous administration, anti-CD32B monoclonal antibody BI-1206 selectively binds to CD32B, a receptor expressed on the surface of B-cells. This prevents CD32B-mediated internalization of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, which abrogates tumor cell resistance caused by CD32B-mediated monoclonal antibody internalization and degradation of CD32B-expressing B-cells. By blocking CD32B, BI-1206 may recover and enhance the activity of rituximab and other anti CD20 monoclonal antibodies. In addition, BI-1206 itself activates the immune system to exert an immune-mediated tumor cell death of B-cells. CD32B, an inhibitory member of the FcgammaR family, is implicated in immune cell desensitization and tumor cell resistance.",fdaUniiCode:"24S6PA0WXW",identifier:"C156458",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:[c,"Anti-hFcgRIIB Monoclonal Antibody BI-1206","Anti-hFcgammaRIIB mAb BI-1206","BI 1206","BI-1206","BI1206"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-CD32B_Monoclonal_Antibody_BI-1206",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-CD32B_Monoclonal_Antibody_BI-1206","Anti-CD32B Monoclonal Antibody BI-1206","2021-10-30T13:34:23.423Z")));
