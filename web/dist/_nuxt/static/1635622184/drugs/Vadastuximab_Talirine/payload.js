The monoclonal antibody portion of vadastuximab talirine specifically binds to the cell surface antigen CD33. This causes the internalization of SGN-CD33A, and the release of the cytotoxic moiety SGD-1882. SGD-1882 binds to and crosslinks DNA, which results in both cell cycle arrest and the induction of apoptosis in CD33-expressing tumor cells. CD33, a transmembrane receptor, is expressed on myeloid leukemia cells.",fdaUniiCode:"T13V17U431",identifier:"C111039",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129823","C1512"],synonyms:["SGN-CD33A","VADASTUXIMAB TALIRINE",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FVadastuximab_Talirine",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Vadastuximab_Talirine","","Vadastuximab Talirine","2021-10-30T13:18:17.153Z")));
