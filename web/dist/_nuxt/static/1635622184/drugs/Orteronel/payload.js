TAK-700 binds to and inhibits the steroid 17alpha-monooxygenase in both the testes and adrenal glands, thereby inhibiting androgen production. This may decrease androgen-dependent growth signaling and may inhibit cell proliferation of androgen-dependent tumor cells. The cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP17A1 (P450C17), localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), exhibits both 17alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities, and plays a key role in the steroidogenic pathway that produces steroidal hormones, such as progestins, mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, androgens, and estrogens.",fdaUniiCode:"UE5K2FNS92",identifier:"C90582",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C471"],synonyms:["6-((7S)-7-hydroxy-6,7-dihydro-5h-pyrrolo(1,2-c)imidazol-7-yl)-N-methyl-2-naphthalenecarboxamide","Androgen Synthesis Inhibitor TAK-700","CYP17A1 Lyase Inhibitor TAK-700","ORTERONEL",a,"TAK-700"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FOrteronel",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Orteronel","","2021-10-30T13:47:12.993Z")));
