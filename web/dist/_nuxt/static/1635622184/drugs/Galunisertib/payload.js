Upon administration, galunisertib specifically targets and binds to the kinase domain of TGFBR1, thereby preventing the activation of TGF-b-mediated signaling pathways. This may inhibit the proliferation of TGF-b-overexpressing tumor cells. Dysregulation of the TGF-b signaling pathway is seen in a number of cancers and is associated with increased cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor progression.",fdaUniiCode:"3OKH1W5LZE",identifier:"C116891",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C61074"],synonyms:["4-(2-(6-Methylpyridin-2-yl)-5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo[1,2-b]pyrazol-3-yl)quinoline-6-carboxamide","GALUNISERTIB",a,"LY-2157299","LY2157299"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FGalunisertib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Galunisertib","","2021-10-30T13:19:23.233Z")));
