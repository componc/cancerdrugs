Defactinib inhibits FAK, which may prevent the integrin-mediated activation of several downstream signal transduction pathways, including those involving RAS\u002FMEK\u002FERK and PI3K\u002FAkt, thus inhibiting tumor cell migration, proliferation, survival, and tumor angiogenesis. The tyrosine kinase FAK, a signal transducer for integrins, is normally activated by binding to integrins in the extracellular matrix (ECM) but may be upregulated and constitutively activated in various tumor cell types.",fdaUniiCode:"53O87HA2QU",identifier:"C79809",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C129825","C1742","C1967"],synonyms:["Benzamide, N-methyl-4-((4-(((3-(methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino)-2-pyrazinyl)methyl)amino)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyrimidinyl)amino)-","DEFACTINIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FDefactinib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Defactinib","","2021-10-30T13:45:25.543Z")));
