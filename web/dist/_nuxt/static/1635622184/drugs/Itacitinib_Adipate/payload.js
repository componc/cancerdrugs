Upon oral administration, itacitinib selectively inhibits JAK-1, thereby inhibiting the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins and the production of proinflammatory factors induced by other cytokines, including interleukin-23 (IL-23) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). The JAK-STAT pathway plays a key role in the signaling of many cytokines and growth factors and is involved in cellular proliferation, growth, hematopoiesis, and the immune response; JAK kinases may be upregulated in inflammatory diseases, myeloproliferative disorders, and various malignancies.",fdaUniiCode:"XZG407XE0Y",identifier:"C158906",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C1967","C574"],synonyms:["INCB-039110 Adipate","INCB039110 Adipate","ITACITINIB ADIPATE",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FItacitinib_Adipate",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Itacitinib_Adipate","","Itacitinib Adipate","2021-10-30T13:34:53.033Z")));
