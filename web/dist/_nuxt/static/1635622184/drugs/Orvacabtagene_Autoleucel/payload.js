Upon administration, orvacabtagene autoleucel specifically recognize and induce selective toxicity in BCMA-expressing tumor cells. BCMA, a tumor-specific antigen and a receptor for both a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) and B-cell activating factor (BAFF), is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) and plays a key role in plasma cell survival. BCMA is found on the surfaces of plasma cells and overexpressed on malignant plasma cells.",fdaUniiCode:"K8RW1TW3EM",identifier:"C147523",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Cell",subclassOf:["C129826","C176023","C28681"],synonyms:["Autologous Anti-BCMA CAR-T Cells JCARH 125","Autologous Anti-BCMA-CAR-4-1BB-CD3zeta-expressing CD4+\u002FCD8+ T-lymphocytes JCARH125","Autologous BCMA 41BBz CAR-T Cell JCARH-125","Autologous BCMA-specific CAR-T Cells JCARH125","Autologous BCMA-specific CAR4-1BB-CD3zeta-expressing CD4+\u002FCD8+ T Lymphocytes JCARH 125","JCARH 125","JCARH-125","JCARH125","ORVACABTAGENE AUTOLEUCEL",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FOrvacabtagene_Autoleucel",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Orvacabtagene_Autoleucel","Orvacabtagene Autoleucel","2021-10-30T13:32:52.483Z")));
