Upon administration of bempegaldesleukin, the IL-2 moiety binds to the IL-2 receptor beta subunit (IL2Rb; IL2Rbeta; CD122). The binding of IL-2 to IL2Rb activates IL2Rb-mediated signaling, which activates cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells, and induces expression of certain cytotoxic cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (IFNg) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGFb). The specific induction of T-cell-mediated cytotoxic immune responses against tumor cells primarily causes tumor cell destruction. IL2Rb plays a key role in the proliferation and activation of effector T-cells. PEG conjugation prevents IL-2 binding to the IL2Ralpha subunit (IL2Ra) because signaling through IL2Ra activates CD4-positive regulatory, immunosuppressive T-cells (Tregs), which would suppress tumor cell killing.",fdaUniiCode:"BNO1JG5MZC",identifier:"C131019",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C587"],synonyms:["Aldesleukin Prodrug NKTR-214","BEMPEGALDESLEUKIN",a,"NKTR-214"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FBempegaldesleukin",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Bempegaldesleukin","","2021-10-30T13:31:20.263Z")));
