Upon administration, the antibody moiety of azintuxizumab vedotin binds to CS1-expressing tumor cells and is internalized, thereby delivering MMAE intracellularly. Upon cleavage, MMAE binds to tubulin and inhibits its polymerization, resulting in G2\u002FM checkpoint arrest and apoptosis in CS1-expressing tumor cells.  CS1 is a cell surface glycoprotein belonging to the CD2 subset of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) and is expressed with high levels and prevalence on multiple myeloma (MM) cells.",fdaUniiCode:"6XQ9TM3U2G",identifier:"C122816",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129823","C575"],synonyms:["ABBV-838","ADC ABBV-838","AZINTUXIZUMAB VEDOTIN",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAzintuxizumab_Vedotin",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Azintuxizumab_Vedotin","","Azintuxizumab Vedotin","2021-10-30T13:29:58.353Z")));
