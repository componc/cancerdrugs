Upon administration, avdoralimab specifically targets, binds to and blocks C5aR expressed on subsets of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and neutrophils. This prevents the binding of its ligand C5a to C5aR and prevents the C5aR-mediated activation and accumulation of these cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), and abrogates the secretion of inflammatory and angiogenic factors by these cells. This results in the activation of T- and natural killer (NK) cells, the induction of anti-tumor immune responses and inhibits tumor cell proliferation. C5a, a factor in the complement cascade, is often overexpressed in tumors, where it attracts and activates MDSCs and neutrophils in the TME.",fdaUniiCode:"DW4CE8MKS9",identifier:"C163020",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:["AVDORALIMAB","Anti-C5aR-215",a,"IPH 5401","IPH-5401","IPH5401","NN 8210"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAvdoralimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Avdoralimab","","2021-10-30T13:35:32.113Z")));
