The trastuzumab moiety of this ADC binds to HER2 on tumor cell surfaces; upon internalization, the DM1 moiety is released and binds to tubulin, thereby disrupting microtubule assembly\u002Fdisassembly dynamics and inhibiting cell division and the proliferation of cancer cells that overexpress HER2.
