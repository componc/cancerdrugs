Tetrahydrouridine increases the efficacy of the radiosensitizer cytochlor (5-chloro-2'-deoxycytidine) by inhibiting the enzyme deoxycytidine monophosphate (dCMP) deaminase and preventing the premature deamination of the cytochlor metabolite 5-chloro-2'-deoxycytidine monophosphate (CldCMP) to 5-chloro-2'-deoxyuridine monophosphate (CldUMP); in turn, this increases tumor concentrations of CldUMP which is then further anabolized and incorporated selectively into tumor DNA as CldU (5-chloro-2'-deoxyuridine).",fdaUniiCode:"0NIZ8H6OL8",identifier:"C868",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Nucleic Acid, Nucleoside, or Nucleotide",subclassOf:["C1557","C2135"],synonyms:["2(1H)-pyrimidinone, tetrahydro-4-hydroxy-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-","TETRAHYDROURIDINE","THU",a,"tetrahydrouridine"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTetrahydrouridine",extension:".json",createdAt:"2021-10-30T13:46:34.323Z",updatedAt:"2021-10-30T13:46:34.333Z"}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Tetrahydrouridine","")));
