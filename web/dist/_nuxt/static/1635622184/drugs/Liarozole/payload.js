As a retinoic acid metabolism blocking agent, liarozole inhibits cytochrome P450-dependent all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)-4-hydroxylase, resulting in an increase in endogenous ATRA production, inhibition of cell proliferation, and induction of cell differentiation. This agent also inhibits aromatase, the enzyme that catalyzes the final, rate-limiting step in estrogen biosynthesis.",fdaUniiCode:"K0Q29TGV9Y",identifier:"C1433",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C2018"],synonyms:["1H-Benzimidazole, 5-((3-chlorophenyl)-1H-imidazol-1-ylmethyl)-","LIAROZOLE",a,"Liazal","R 75251","R-61405","liarozole"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FLiarozole",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Liarozole","2021-10-30T13:32:38.953Z")));
