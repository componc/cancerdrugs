Upon administration, anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody FAZ053 binds to PD-L1, blocking its binding to and activation of its receptor programmed death 1 (PD-1), which may enhance the T-cell-mediated anti-tumor immune response and reverse T-cell inactivation. PD-L1 is overexpressed by many human cancer cell types. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion. PD-1, a transmembrane protein expressed on activated T-cells, is a negative regulator of the immune system that limits the expansion and survival of CD8+ T-cells.",fdaUniiCode:"V6W1OW12H2",identifier:"C131537",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C128057","C129822"],synonyms:[c,"FAZ 053","FAZ-053","FAZ053"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-PD-L1_Monoclonal_Antibody_FAZ053",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-PD-L1_Monoclonal_Antibody_FAZ053","Anti-PD-L1 Monoclonal Antibody FAZ053","2021-10-30T13:31:26.413Z")));
