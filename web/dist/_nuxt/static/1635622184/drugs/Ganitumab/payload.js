Ganitumab binds to membrane-bound IGF-1R, preventing binding of the ligand IGF-1 and the subsequent triggering of the PI3K\u002FAkt signaling pathway; inhibition of this survival signaling pathway may result in the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. IGF-1R is a tyrosine kinase and a member of the insulin receptor family. IGF-1R activation stimulates cell proliferation, enables oncogenic transformation, and suppresses apoptosis; IGF-1R signaling has been highly implicated in tumorigenesis and metastasis.",fdaUniiCode:"CK1441RCZ8",identifier:"C71531",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:["AMG 479","Anti-IGF-1R Human Monoclonal Antibody AMG-479","GANITUMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FGanitumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Ganitumab","","2021-10-30T13:43:39.943Z")));
