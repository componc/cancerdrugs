Upon intravesical administration, dT-A chain expression is triggered by the presence of H19 transcription factors that are upregulated in tumor cells. The dT-A chain binds to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and inactivates the ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor 2 (EF2), resulting in the inhibition of protein synthesis and cell death leading to tumor cell destruction. Inodiftagene Vixteplasmid does not carry the gene for the diphtheria toxin-B (dT-B) chain, thereby preventing the transfer of the toxic dT-A chain between cells. H19, a paternally imprinted, oncofetal gene, is highly expressed in embryonic and certain malignant tissues, but minimally expressed in normal, adult tissues.",fdaUniiCode:"98YK326XZ6",identifier:"C157333",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129821","C1962","C61199"],synonyms:["BC 819","BC-819","BC819","Diphtheria-toxin-A-H19","INODIFTAGENE VIXTEPLASMID",c,"dT-A-H19"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FInodiftagene_Vixteplasmid",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Inodiftagene_Vixteplasmid","Inodiftagene Vixteplasmid","2021-10-30T13:34:37.273Z")));
