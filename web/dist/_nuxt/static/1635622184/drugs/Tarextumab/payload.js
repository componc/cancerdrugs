Tarextumab binds to Notch on the cell surface, thereby inhibiting Notch-mediated signaling and gene transcription, which may impede tumor angiogenesis. Notch receptors are important for cell-cell communication, which involves gene regulation mechanisms that control multiple cell differentiation processes during embryonic and adult life. Dysregulated Notch signaling is implicated in many diseases including T-ALL (T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia), CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Sub-cortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy), MS (Multiple Sclerosis), and many other disease states.",fdaUniiCode:"333YMY788E",identifier:"C95719",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Immunologic Factor",subclassOf:["C20401"],synonyms:["MoAb OMP-59R5","OMP 59R5","OMP-59R5","TAREXTUMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTarextumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Tarextumab","","2021-10-30T13:48:04.983Z")));
