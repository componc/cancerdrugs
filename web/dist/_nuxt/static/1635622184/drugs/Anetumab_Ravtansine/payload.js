The monoclonal antibody moiety of anetumab ravtansine targets and binds to the tumor associated antigen mesothelin; upon internalization, the DM4 moiety binds to tubulin and disrupts microtubule assembly\u002Fdisassembly dynamics, resulting in inhibition of cell division and cell growth of mesothelin-expressing tumor cells. Mesothelin is overexpressed on all mesotheliomas as well as many ovarian and pancreatic cancers while minimally expressed on normal tissue.",fdaUniiCode:"M170940PMI",identifier:"C98293",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129823","C1512"],synonyms:["ANETUMAB RAVTANSINE",c,"BAY 94-9343"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnetumab_Ravtansine",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Anetumab_Ravtansine","","Anetumab Ravtansine","2021-10-30T13:48:51.733Z")));
