Parsaclisib inhibits the delta isoform of PI3K and prevents the activation of the PI3K\u002FAKT signaling pathway. This both decreases proliferation and induces cell death in PI3K-delta-overexpressing tumor cells. Unlike other isoforms of PI3K, PI3K-delta is expressed primarily in hematopoietic disease and cell lineages. The targeted inhibition of PI3K-delta is designed to preserve PI3K signaling in normal, non-neoplastic cells. PI3K, an enzyme often overexpressed in cancer cells, plays a crucial role in tumor cell regulation and survival.",fdaUniiCode:"S0GJ8VM4P9",identifier:"C166387",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C2152"],synonyms:["(4R)-4-(3-((1S)-1-(4-amino-3-methyl-1h-pyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrimidin-1-yl)ethyl)-5-chloro-2-ethoxy-6-fluorophenyl)pyrrolidin-2-onehydrochloric Acid (1:1)","2-Pyrrolidinone, 4-(3-((1S)-1-(4-amino-3-methyl-1h-pyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrimidin-1-yl)ethyl)-5-chloro-2-ethoxy-6-fluorophenyl)-, Hydrochloride (1:1), (4R)-","INCB 50465 Hydrochloride","INCB050465 Hydrochloride","PARSACLISIB HYDROCHLORIDE",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FParsaclisib_Hydrochloride",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Parsaclisib_Hydrochloride","","Parsaclisib Hydrochloride","2021-10-30T13:35:46.913Z")));
