Inhibition of MEK1\u002F2 prevents the activation of MEK1\u002F2 dependent effector proteins and transcription factors, which may result in the inhibition of growth factor-mediated cell signaling. This may eventually lead to an inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and an inhibition in production of various inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1, -6 and tumor necrosis factor. MEK1\u002F2 are dual-specificity threonine\u002Ftyrosine kinases that play key roles in the activation of the RAS\u002FRAF\u002FMEK\u002FERK pathway and are often upregulated in a variety of tumor cell types.",fdaUniiCode:"181R97MR71",identifier:"C84865",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C69145"],synonyms:["ARRY-162","ARRY-438162","BINIMETINIB",a,"MEK162",d]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FBinimetinib",extension:".json",createdAt:e,updatedAt:e}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Binimetinib","","binimetinib","Mektovi","2021-10-30T13:46:21.303Z")));
