Upon oral administration linperlisib selectively binds to and inhibits PI3K-delta and prevents the activation of the PI3K\u002FAKT signaling pathway. This decreases proliferation of and induces cell death in PI3K-delta over-expressing tumor cells. PI3K-delta also plays a key role in the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway and the proliferation of certain hematologic cancer cells. The targeted inhibition of PI3K-delta is designed to preserve PI3K signaling in normal, non-neoplastic cells, thereby minimizing serious side effects.",fdaUniiCode:"05HYK3CV9N",identifier:"C158508",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C2152"],synonyms:["LINPERLISIB",a,"PI3K-delta Inhibitor YY-20394","YY 20394","YY-20394","YY20394"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FLinperlisib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Linperlisib","","2021-10-30T13:34:48.123Z")));
