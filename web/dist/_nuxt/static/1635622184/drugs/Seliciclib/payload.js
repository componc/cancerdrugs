CDKs, serine\u002Fthreonine kinases that play an important role in cell cycle regulation, are overexpressed in various malignancies. Seliciclib primarily inhibits CDK 2, 7, and 9 by competing for the ATP binding sites on these kinases, leading to a disruption of cell cycle progression. In addition, this agent seems to interfere with CDK-mediated phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, thereby inhibiting RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription. This may lead to the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic factors, such as myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1), a protein crucial for the survival of a range of tumor cell types. The down-regulation of anti-apoptotic factors may lead to an induction of apoptosis, thereby further contributing to seliciclib's antiproliferative effects.",fdaUniiCode:"0ES1C2KQ94",identifier:"C62783",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C129825","C2185"],synonyms:["CYC202","R-roscovitine","SELICICLIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSeliciclib",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Seliciclib","2021-10-30T13:42:18.493Z")));
