Upon oral administration, pirtobrutinib selectively and reversibly binds to BTK. This prevents both the activation of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling pathway and BTK-mediated activation of downstream survival pathways, thereby inhibiting the growth of malignant B-cells that overexpress BTK. Reversible binding of LOXO-305 may preserve antitumor activity in the presence of certain acquired resistance mutations, including C481 mutated BTK, and limit toxicity associated with inhibition of other non-BTK kinases. BTK, a member of the Src-related BTK\u002FTec family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, is overexpressed or mutated in B-cell malignancies; it plays an important role in the development, activation, signaling, proliferation and survival of B-lymphocytes.",fdaUniiCode:"JNA39I7ZVB",identifier:"C158617",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C124801","C129825"],synonyms:["5-Amino-3-(4-((5-fluoro-2-methoxybenzamido)methyl)phenyl)-1-((2S)-1,1,1-trifluoropropan-2-yl)-1h-pyrazole-4-carboxamide","BTK Inhibitor LOXO-305","LOXO 305","LOXO-305","LOXO305","LY3527727","PIRTOBRUTINIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FPirtobrutinib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Pirtobrutinib","","2021-10-30T13:34:50.673Z")));
