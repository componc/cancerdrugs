Upon oral administration, fadraciclib selectively binds to and inhibits the activity of CDK2, 5 and 9, which leads to inhibition of CDK2, 5 and 9-dependent cellular pathways, downregulation of genes involved in the pro-survival pathway, prevention of the activation of DNA double-strand break repair pathways, and induction of both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. This inhibits the proliferation of CDK2\u002F5\u002F9-overexpressing tumor cells. In addition, CYC065 protects hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), prevents myelosuppression, and preserves the function of the bone marrow. CDKs are serine\u002Fthreonine kinases involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and may be overexpressed in certain cancer cell types; they play key roles in tumor cell proliferation, the regulation of transcription, and DNA damage repair.",fdaUniiCode:"YET2XNU791",identifier:"C123902",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C129825","C2185"],synonyms:["CYC065","Cyclin Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 2\u002F5\u002F9 CYC065","FADRACICLIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FFadraciclib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Fadraciclib","","2021-10-30T13:30:10.493Z")));
