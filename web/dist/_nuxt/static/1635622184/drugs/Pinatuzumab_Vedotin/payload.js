Upon administration, the monoclonal antibody moiety of pinatuzumab vedotin binds to B cell-specific CD22 receptors and is rapidly internalized, thereby delivering MMAE intracellularly. Upon proteolytic cleavage, MMAE binds to tubulin and inhibits its polymerization, resulting in G2\u002FM phase arrest and tumor cell apoptosis. CD22, a cell surface glycoprotein, is expressed on mature B-cells and on most malignant B-cells.",fdaUniiCode:"6KA1906BLC",identifier:"C104167",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C155713"],synonyms:["ADC DCDT2980S","Antibody-Drug Conjugate DCDT2980S","DCDT2980S","PINATUZUMAB VEDOTIN",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FPinatuzumab_Vedotin",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Pinatuzumab_Vedotin","","Pinatuzumab Vedotin","2021-10-30T13:17:33.153Z")));
