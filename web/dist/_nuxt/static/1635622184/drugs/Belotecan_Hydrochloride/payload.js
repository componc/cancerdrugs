Belotecan binds to and inhibits the activity of topoisomerase I, stabilizing the cleavable complex of topoisomerase I-DNA, which inhibits the religation of single-stranded DNA breaks generated by topoisomerase I; lethal double-stranded DNA breaks occur when the topoisomerase I-DNA complex is encountered by the DNA replication machinery, DNA replication is disrupted, and the tumor cell undergoes apoptosis. Topoisomerase I is an enzyme that mediates reversible single-strand breaks in DNA during DNA replication.",fdaUniiCode:"01DZ4127G7",identifier:"C66954",preferredName:b,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C2843"],synonyms:["BELOTECAN HYDROCHLORIDE",b,"CKD602 HCl","belotecan hydrochloride"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FBelotecan_Hydrochloride",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Belotecan_Hydrochloride","Belotecan Hydrochloride","2021-10-30T13:43:07.383Z")));
