Butyrate, a short chain fatty acid, competitively binds to the zinc sites of class I and II histone deacetylases (HDACs). This binding affects hyperacetylation of histones, resulting in a modified DNA conformation, which subsequently leads to the uncoiling or relaxing of chromatin. Enhanced accessibility of chromatin to transcription-regulatory complexes leads to increased transcriptional activation of various epigenetically suppressed genes. Butyrate, a HDAC inhibitor, induces cell cycle arrest in G1 or G2\u002FM and also increases the expression of other genes and proteins involved in cellular differentiation and apoptotic signaling.",fdaUniiCode:"8RAS91C36W",identifier:"C2337",preferredName:b,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C1946"],synonyms:["Butyrate","Butyrate sodium","Butyric Acid, Sodium Salt","SODIUM BUTYRATE",b,"Sodium butanoate","Sodium butyrate","butyric acid, sodium salt","sodium butanoate"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSodium_Butyrate",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Sodium_Butyrate","Sodium Butyrate","2021-10-30T13:37:32.693Z")));
