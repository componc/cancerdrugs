Upon administration, batiraxcept selectively binds to growth arrest-specific protein 6 (GAS6), the endogenous ligand for AXL. This may inhibit GAS6\u002FAXL-mediated signaling, which plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation, survival, invasion and metastasis, as well as immune evasion and resistance to other anticancer agents. AXL, a member of the Tyro3, AXL and Mer (TAM) family of RTKs, is overexpressed by many tumor cell types and its expression is associated with drug resistance and poor prognosis.",fdaUniiCode:"B6840JH4EB",identifier:"C156017",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C2189"],synonyms:["AVB S6 500","AVB-500","AVB-S6-500","AVBS6500","AXL Fc Fusion Protein AVB-S6-500","Anti-AXL Fusion Protein AVB-S6-500","BATIRAXCEPT",a,"RUGA-S6"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FBatiraxcept",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Batiraxcept","","2021-10-30T13:34:17.943Z")));
