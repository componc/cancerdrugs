Samotolisib inhibits both certain PI3K isoforms and mTOR in an ATP-competitive manner which may inhibit both the PI3K\u002FmTOR signaling pathway in and proliferation of tumor cells overexpressing PI3K and\u002For mTOR. The PI3K\u002FmTOR pathway is upregulated in a variety of tumor cells and plays a key role in promoting cancer cell proliferation, and survival, motility and resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. mTOR, a serine\u002Fthreonine kinase downstream of PI3K, may also be activated in a PI3K-independent fashion; therefore, this agent may be more potent than an agent that inhibits either PI3K or mTOR alone. In addition, LY3023414 may inhibit DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), thereby inhibiting the ability of tumor cells to repair damaged DNA. DNA-PK is activated upon DNA damage and plays a key role in repairing double-stranded DNA breaks.",fdaUniiCode:"C88817F47Y",identifier:"C121817",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C1404"],synonyms:["2H-Imidazo(4,5-C)quinolin-2-one, 1,3-Dihydro-8-(5-(1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)-3-pyridinyl)-1-((2S)-2-methoxypropyl)-3-methyl-","LY 3023414","LY-3023414","LY3023414","PI3K\u002FmTOR Inhibitor LY3023414","SAMOTOLISIB",a,"WHO 10889"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSamotolisib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Samotolisib","","2021-10-30T13:20:19.443Z")));
