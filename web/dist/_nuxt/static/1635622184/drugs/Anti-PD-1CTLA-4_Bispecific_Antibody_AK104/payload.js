Upon administration, anti-PD1\u002FCTLA4 bispecific antibody AK104 targets and binds to both PD-1 and CTLA4 expressed on tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs), and inhibits the PD-1- and CTLA4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation and proliferation. This restores immune function and activates a sustained cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against tumor cells. Both PD-1 and CTLA4 are selectively expressed on TILs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and negatively regulate the activation and effector functions of T-cells. They play key roles in the downregulation of the immune system and tumor evasion from host immunity. Dual checkpoint blockade of PD1 and CTLA4 with AK104 may enhance T-cell activation and proliferation more than the blockade of either immune checkpoint receptor alone.",fdaUniiCode:"6FYG1DS4NW",identifier:"C153379",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129822","C143250","C28227"],synonyms:["AK 104","AK-104","AK104","Anti-PD-1 x CTLA-4 Bispecific Antibody AK104",c,"Anti-PD1\u002FAnti-CTLA4 Bispecific Antibody AK104","PD-1 x CTLA-4 Dual Checkpoint Inhibitor AK104"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-PD-1CTLA-4_Bispecific_Antibody_AK104",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-PD-1CTLA-4_Bispecific_Antibody_AK104","Anti-PD-1\u002FCTLA-4 Bispecific Antibody AK104","2021-10-30T13:34:04.993Z")));
