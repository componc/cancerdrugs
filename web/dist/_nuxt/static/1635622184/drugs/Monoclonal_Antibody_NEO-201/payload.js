Upon intravenous administration, monoclonal antibody NEO-201 targets and binds to malignant tissues with tumor-specific mutations in the membrane-anchored proteins, carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules 5 and 6 (CEACAM5 and CEACAM6). This prevents the interaction between tumor cell CEACAM 5 and natural killer (NK) cell CEACAM1, and reverses CEACAM1-dependent inhibition of NK cytotoxicity. This may result in the activation of NKs and results in NK-mediated tumor cell killing. Additionally, monoclonal antibody NEO-201 may activate innate immune responses against tumor cells such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). CEACAM 5, and 6 are members of the CEA family of proteins. These membrane proteins are over expressed in a variety of cancer cell types and play a key role in cell migration, invasion, and adhesion.",fdaUniiCode:"41E6FO0DX2",identifier:"C156398",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:[c,"NEO 201","NEO-201","NEO201","Neoantigen-targeting Antibody NEO-201","h16C3","h16C3 Antibody"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FMonoclonal_Antibody_NEO-201",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Monoclonal_Antibody_NEO-201","Monoclonal Antibody NEO-201","2021-10-30T13:34:21.533Z")));
