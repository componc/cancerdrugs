Upon administration, sasanlimab targets and binds to PD-1 and blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) and PD-1 ligand 2 (PD-L2). This prevents the activation of PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore immune function through the activation of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) against tumor cells. PD-1, an inhibitory receptor belonging to the B7-receptor family, is expressed on activated T-lymphocytes, B-cells and NK cells; it functions as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands, and plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.",fdaUniiCode:"LZZ0IC2EWP",identifier:"C124058",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C124946","C129820"],synonyms:["Anti-PD-1 PF-06801591","PF-06801591","SASANLIMAB",a,"WHO 11161"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSasanlimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Sasanlimab","","2021-10-30T13:30:14.743Z")));
