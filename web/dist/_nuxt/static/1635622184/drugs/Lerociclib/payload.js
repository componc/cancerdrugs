Upon administration, lerociclib selectively inhibits CDK4 and CDK6, which inhibits the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb) early in the G1 phase, prevents CDK-mediated G1-S phase transition and leads to cell cycle arrest. This suppresses DNA replication and decreases tumor cell proliferation. CDK4 and 6 are serine\u002Fthreonine kinases that are upregulated in many tumor cell types and play a key role in the regulation of both cell cycle progression from the G1-phase into the S-phase and tumor cell proliferation.",fdaUniiCode:"WBH8AY6ENB",identifier:"C138165",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C61074"],synonyms:["7',8'-Dihydro-2'-((5-(4-(1-methylethyl)-1-piperazinyl)-2-pyridinyl)amino)spiro(cyclohexane-1,9'(6'H)-pyrazino(1',2':1,5)pyrrolo(2,3-d)pyrimidin)-6'-one","CDK4\u002F6 Inhibitor G1T38","G1T38","G1T38 Free Base","LEROCICLIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FLerociclib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Lerociclib","","2021-10-30T13:32:09.603Z")));
