Upon administration, pimivalimab targets, binds to and inhibits PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore immune function through the activation of T-cells and T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. PD-1, a transmembrane protein in the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) expressed on T-cells, functions as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) or 2 (PD-L2); it plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.",fdaUniiCode:"MA05AF40UO",identifier:"C157485",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C128037","C129822"],synonyms:["Anti-PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody JTX-4014","JTX 4014","JTX-4014","JTX4014","PIMIVALIMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FPimivalimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Pimivalimab","","2021-10-30T13:34:39.463Z")));
