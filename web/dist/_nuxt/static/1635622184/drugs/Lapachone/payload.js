Beta-lapachone (b-lap) is bioactivated by NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1), creating a futile oxidoreduction that generates high levels of superoxide. In turn, the highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) interact with DNA, thereby causing single-strand DNA breaks and calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores. Eventually, the extensive DNA damage causes hyperactivation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), an enzyme facilitating DNA repair, accompanied by rapid depletion of NAD+\u002FATP nucleotide levels. As a result, a caspase-independent and ER-stress induced mu-calpain-mediated cell death occurs in NQO1-overexpressing tumor cells. NQO1, a flavoprotein and two-electron oxidoreductase, is overexpressed in a variety of tumors.",fdaUniiCode:"6N4FA2QQ6A",identifier:"C28694",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C129839","C2189","C798"],synonyms:["3,4-Dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-2H-naphtho(1,2-b)pyran-5,6-dione","ARQ 501","ARQ501","Beta-Lap-WJ","Beta-Lapachone","LAPACHONE",a,"beta-Lapachone"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FLapachone",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Lapachone","2021-10-30T13:38:34.433Z")));
