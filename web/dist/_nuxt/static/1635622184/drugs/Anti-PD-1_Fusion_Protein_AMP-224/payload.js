Anti-PD-1 fusion protein AMP-224 specifically binds to PD-1 on chronically stimulated T-cells and reduces their proliferation. This may restore immune function and may result in the activation of cytotoxic T-cells and cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. PD-1, a transmembrane protein of Ig superfamily and inhibitor receptor expressed on activated T-cells, negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands, and plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity. AMP-224 does not bind normal activated T-cells.",fdaUniiCode:"SKF3JJJ5QA",identifier:"C97039",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C124946","C129820"],synonyms:["AMP-224",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-PD-1_Fusion_Protein_AMP-224",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-PD-1_Fusion_Protein_AMP-224","Anti-PD-1 Fusion Protein AMP-224","2021-10-30T13:48:30.153Z")));
