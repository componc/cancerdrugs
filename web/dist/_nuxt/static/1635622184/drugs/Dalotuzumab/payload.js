Dalotuzumab binds to membrane-bound IGF1R, preventing binding of the ligand IGF1 and the subsequent triggering of the PI3K\u002FAkt signaling pathway; inhibition of this survival signaling pathway may result in the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. The activation of IGF1R, a tyrosine kinase and a member of the insulin receptor family, stimulates cell proliferation, enables oncogenic transformation, and suppresses apoptosis; IGF1R signaling has been highly implicated in tumorigenesis and metastasis.",fdaUniiCode:"6YI1L648RH",identifier:"C74011",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:["Anti-IGF-1R Recombinant Monoclonal Antibody MK-0646","DALOTUZUMAB",a,"MK-0646","anti-IGF1R recombinant monoclonal antibody MK-0646"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FDalotuzumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Dalotuzumab","","2021-10-30T13:44:15.013Z")));
