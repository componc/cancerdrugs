Upon intravenous administration, nivatrotamab binds to CD3 on T-cells and disialoganglioside GD2 expressed on certain tumor cells, thereby cross-linking T-cells with GD2-expressing tumor cells. This promotes a selective cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against GD2-expressing cells. The Fc region of the anti-GD2 hu3F8\u002Fanti-CD3 huOKT3 bispecific antibody has two amino acid substitutions, N297A and K322A, which may prevent cytokine release syndrome and other unwanted side effects including complement-mediated pain. GD2, a disialoganglioside and tumor-associated antigen (TAA), is overexpressed in a variety of tumor cell types. CD3 is part of the functional T-cell receptor (TCR) complex, which is necessary for antigen recognition by T-cells and is required for signal transduction.",fdaUniiCode:"8RV18E4A94",identifier:"C158436",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C28227"],synonyms:["Anti-GD2 hu3F8\u002FAnti-CD3 huOKT3 Bispecific Antibody","Humanized 3F8 Bispecific Antibody","Humanized Anti-GD2 x Anti-CD3 Bispecific Antibody","NIVATROTAMAB",a,"hu3F8 x huOKT3 Bispecific Antibody","hu3F8-BsAb"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FNivatrotamab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Nivatrotamab","","2021-10-30T13:34:47.213Z")));
