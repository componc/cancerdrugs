Doxazosin is an alpha-adrenergic antagonist that selectively inhibits alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. Blockages of the alpha-1 adrenergic action on the vascular smooth muscles lead to a decrease in vascular resistance and antihypertensive activity. This agent also shows high affinity to alpha-1c adrenoceptor, the predominant functional type in the prostate, which may partially attribute to its effect in treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Furthermore, doxazosin induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells mediated through inhibition of protein kinase B (PKB)\u002FAkt-signaling death receptor regulatory pathway.",fdaUniiCode:"NW1291F1W8",identifier:"C61737",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C29707","C29713"],synonyms:["DOXAZOSIN",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FDoxazosin",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Doxazosin","2021-10-30T13:41:45.423Z")));
