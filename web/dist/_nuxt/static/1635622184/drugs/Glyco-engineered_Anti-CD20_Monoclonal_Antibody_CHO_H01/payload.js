Upon administration of glyco-engineered anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody CHO H01, the antibody specifically targets and binds to CD20. This induces antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against CD20-expressing B-cells, which leads to B-cell apoptosis and the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. In addition, CHO H01 inhibits CD20-mediated signaling which further induces apoptosis in and inhibits proliferation of CD20-expressing tumor cells. CD20, a non-glycosylated cell surface phosphoprotein that is exclusively expressed on B-cells during most stages of B-cell development, is often overexpressed in B-cell malignancies. The Fc-glycans are homogenously engineered onto the antibody and increase ADCC, anti-tumor activity and the half-life of the antibody.",fdaUniiCode:"OJ72N0B4UC",identifier:"C151952",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Immunologic Factor",subclassOf:["C129822","C141215"],synonyms:["CHO H01","CHO-H01",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FGlyco-engineered_Anti-CD20_Monoclonal_Antibody_CHO_H01",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Glyco-engineered_Anti-CD20_Monoclonal_Antibody_CHO_H01","Glyco-engineered Anti-CD20 Monoclonal Antibody CHO H01","2021-10-30T13:33:31.003Z")));
