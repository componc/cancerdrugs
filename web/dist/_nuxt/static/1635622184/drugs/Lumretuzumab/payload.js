Upon administration,  lumretuzumab binds to the extracellular domain of HER3 and inhibits HER3 dimerization; thereby, preventing EGFR-dependent signaling. In addition, RO5479599 stimulates the immune system to exert antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). This may decrease proliferation of HER3-overexpressing tumor cells. HER3, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of receptor tyrosine kinases, is frequently overexpressed in tumors; it has no active kinase domain but is activated through heterodimerization with other members of the EGFR receptor family, such as HER2.",fdaUniiCode:"Y6M3205516",identifier:"C104058",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129822","C1512","C20401"],synonyms:["LUMRETUZUMAB",a,"RO5479599"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FLumretuzumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Lumretuzumab","","2021-10-30T13:17:31.973Z")));
