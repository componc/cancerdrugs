Upon administration, etrumadenant competes with tumor-released adenosine for binding to A2AR and A2BR expressed on numerous intra-tumoral immune cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs), natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages and T-lymphocytes. The binding of AB928 to A2AR and A2BR inhibits A2AR\u002FA2BR activity and prevents adenosine-A2AR\u002FA2BR-mediated signaling. A2AR\u002FA2BR inhibition activates and enhances the proliferation of various immune cells, abrogates the adenosine-mediated immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and activates the immune system to exert anti-tumor immune responses against cancer cells, which leads to tumor cell killing. A2AR and A2BR, G protein-coupled signaling receptors, are expressed on the cell surfaces of numerous immune cells. Adenosine is often overproduced by tumor cells and plays a key role in immunosuppression and tumor cell proliferation.",fdaUniiCode:"W0ZE0NT8IF",identifier:"C159564",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C2139"],synonyms:["A2AR\u002FA2BR Antagonist AB928","AB 928","AB-928","AB928","Adenosine A2A\u002FA2B Receptor Antagonist AB928","Dual A2AR\u002FA2BR Antagonist AB928",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FEtrumadenant",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Etrumadenant","","2021-10-30T13:34:55.863Z")));
