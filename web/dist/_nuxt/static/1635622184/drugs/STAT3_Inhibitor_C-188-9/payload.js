Upon oral administration, the STAT3 inhibitor C-188-9 specifically targets and binds to the phosphotyrosyl peptide binding site within the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of STAT3. This inhibits the Janus kinase (JAK)-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STAT3. This impedes nuclear translocation of STAT3, prevents STAT3 binding to responsive gene promoters and blocks STAT3-mediated regulation of gene expression. STAT3 regulates the transcription of genes involved in several cellular functions. STAT3 is constitutively activated in a variety of human cancers and plays a key role in neoplastic transformation, uncontrolled tumor cell proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, metastasis, immune evasion, tumor angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the Warburg effect.",fdaUniiCode:"KZ3DLD11RQ",identifier:"C151932",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C2189"],synonyms:["C-188-9","C188-9",c,"STAT3 Inhibitor TTI-101","STAT3 Inhibitor XIII","TTI 101","TTI-101","TTI101"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSTAT3_Inhibitor_C-188-9",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("STAT3_Inhibitor_C-188-9","","STAT3 Inhibitor C-188-9","2021-10-30T13:33:28.573Z")));
