Upon administration, anti-OX40\u002FCD137 bispecific antibody FS120 simultaneously targets, binds to, and activates both OX40 and CD137. This may lead to T-cell co-stimulation, induce the proliferation of memory and effector T-lymphocytes and enhance immune-mediated anti-tumor responses. OX40 and CD137, cell surface glycoproteins and members of the TNFRSF, are expressed on T-lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells and play an essential role in T-cell activation, differentiation, proliferation, survival and cytolytic activity.",fdaUniiCode:"CAN96F6UCF",identifier:"C178418",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C1454","C155745","C96040"],synonyms:["Anti-OX40\u002FAnti-CD137 Bispecific Antibody FS120",c,"Bispecific Antibody FS120","FS 120","FS-120","FS120","OX40 x CD137 Bispecific Antibody FS120"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-OX40CD137_Bispecific_Antibody_FS120",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Anti-OX40CD137_Bispecific_Antibody_FS120","","Anti-OX40\u002FCD137 Bispecific Antibody FS120","2021-10-30T13:36:33.153Z")));
