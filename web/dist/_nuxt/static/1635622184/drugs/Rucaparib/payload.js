Upon administration, rucaparib selectively binds to PARP1, 2 and 3 and inhibits PARP-mediated DNA repair. This enhances the accumulation of DNA strand breaks, promotes genomic instability and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. This may enhance the cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging agents and reverse tumor cell resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. PARPs are enzymes activated by single-strand DNA breaks that catalyze the post-translational ADP-ribosylation of nuclear proteins, which induces signaling and the recruitment of other proteins to repair damaged DNA. The PARP-mediated repair pathway plays a key role in DNA repair and is dysregulated in a variety of cancer cell types.",fdaUniiCode:"8237F3U7EH",identifier:"C137800",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C62554"],synonyms:["6H-Pyrrolo(4,3,2-ef)(2)benzazepin-6-one, 8-Fluoro-1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-2-(4-((methylamino)methyl)phenyl)-","8-Fluoro-2-(4-((methylamino)methyl)phenyl)-1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-6H-azepino(5,4,3-cd)indol-6-one","RUCAPARIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FRucaparib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Rucaparib","","2021-10-30T13:32:02.473Z")));
