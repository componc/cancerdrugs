Ultralow-molecular-weight heparin AVE5026 binds to and activates antithrombin III (ATIII), which may result in the inhibition of activated factor Xa and, to a much lesser extent, factor IIa (thrombin) and so the inhibition of fibrin formation. Compared to low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs), AVE5026 exhibits an even higher ratio of anti-Factor Xa to anti-Factor IIa activity (\u003E30:1). Compared to unfractionated heparins, the use of LMWHs is associated with lower incidences of major bleeding, osteoporosis and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Like LMWHs, this agent may inhibit tumor growth by regulating angiogenesis and apoptosis. AVE5026 is prepared by partial depolymerization of unfractionated porcine mucosal heparin.",fdaUniiCode:"4QW4AN84NQ",identifier:"C78447",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C263"],synonyms:["AVE-5026","AVE5026","SEMULOPARIN",a,"ULMW heparin AVE5026","Ultra-low-molecular-weight Heparin (2000-3000 MW; Phosphazene Depolymerization)","Ultralow-Molecular-Weight Heparin AVE5026"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSemuloparin",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Semuloparin","2021-10-30T13:45:09.373Z")));
