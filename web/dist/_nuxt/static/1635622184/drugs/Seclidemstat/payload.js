Upon oral administration, seclidemstat reversibly inhibits LSD1, a demethylase that suppresses the expression of target genes by converting the di- and mono-methylated forms of lysine at position 4 of histone 3 (H3K4) to mono- and unmethylated H3K4, respectively. LSD1 inhibition enhances H3K4 methylation and increases the expression of tumor suppressor genes. This may lead to an inhibition of cell growth in LSD1-overexpressing tumor cells. In addition, LSD1 demethylates mono- or di-methylated H3K9 which increases gene expression of tumor promoting genes; inhibition of LSD1 promotes H3K9 methylation and decreases transcription of these genes.",fdaUniiCode:"TYH386V3WJ",identifier:"C154328",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825"],synonyms:["LSD1 Inhibitor SP-2577","SECLIDEMSTAT","SP 2577","SP-2577","SP2577",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSeclidemstat",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Seclidemstat","","2021-10-30T13:34:08.023Z")));
