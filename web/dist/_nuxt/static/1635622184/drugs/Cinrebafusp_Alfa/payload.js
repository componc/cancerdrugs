Upon administration of cinrebafusp alfa, CD137 clustering is promoted by bridging CD137-positive T-cells with HER2-positive tumor cells, leading to the recruitment of tumor antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). This may result in potent CTL-mediated lysis of HER2-expressing tumor cells. HER2 plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization. CD137 is a costimulatory immunoreceptor and a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF). Anticalins are synthetic antigen-binding proteins derived from lipocalins. Structurally dissimilar to antibodies, anticalins are able to bind to smaller antigens and exhibit improved tissue penetration.",fdaUniiCode:"21Z359Z1CV",identifier:"C142890",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129820"],synonyms:["Anti-HER2 Monoclonal Antibody\u002FAnti-CD137Anticalin Bispecific Fusion Protein PRS-343","CINREBAFUSP ALFA",c,"PRS-343"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FCinrebafusp_Alfa",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Cinrebafusp_Alfa","","Cinrebafusp Alfa","2021-10-30T13:32:34.783Z")));
