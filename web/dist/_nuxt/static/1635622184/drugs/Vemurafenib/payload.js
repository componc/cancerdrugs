Vemurafenib selectively binds to the ATP-binding site of BRAF(V600E) kinase and inhibits its activity, which may result in an inhibition of an over-activated MAPK signaling pathway downstream in BRAF(V600E) kinase-expressing tumor cells and a reduction in tumor cell proliferation. Approximately 90% of BRAF gene mutations involve a valine-to-glutamic acid mutation at residue 600 (V600E); the oncogene protein product, BRAF(V600E) kinase, exhibits a markedly elevated activity that over-activates the MAPK signaling pathway. The BRAF(V600E) gene mutation has been found to occur in approximately 60% of melanomas, and in about 8% of all solid tumors, including melanoma, colorectal, thyroid and other cancers.",fdaUniiCode:"207SMY3FQT",identifier:"C64768",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C129825","C155322"],synonyms:["1-propanesulfonamide, n-(3-((5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1h-pyrrolo(2,3-b)pyridin-3-yl)carbonyl)-2,4-difluorophenyl)-","BRAF (V600E) kinase inhibitor RO5185426","BRAF(V600E) Kinase Inhibitor RO5185426","PLX-4032","PLX4032","RG 7204","RG7204","RO 5185426","VEMURAFENIB",a,c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FVemurafenib",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Vemurafenib","vemurafenib","Zelboraf","2021-10-30T13:42:35.653Z")));
