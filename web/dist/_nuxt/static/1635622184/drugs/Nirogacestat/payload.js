Nirogacestat binds to GS, blocking proteolytic activation of Notch receptors; Notch signaling pathway inhibition may follow, which may result in the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells that overexpress Notch. The integral membrane protein GS is a multi-subunit protease complex that cleaves single-pass transmembrane proteins, such as Notch receptors, at residues within their transmembrane domains. Overexpression of the Notch signaling pathway has been correlated with increased tumor cell growth and survival.",fdaUniiCode:"QZ62892OFJ",identifier:"C82383",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C471"],synonyms:["(S)-2-(((S)-6,8-Difluoro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-yl)amino)-N-(1-(2-methyl-1-(neopentylamino)propan-2-yl)-1H-imidazol-4-yl)pentanamide","NIROGACESTAT",a,"PF-03084014"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FNirogacestat",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Nirogacestat","","2021-10-30T13:45:56.573Z")));
