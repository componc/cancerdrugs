Upon intravenous administration, lisocabtagene maraleucel is directed to and induces selective toxicity in CD19-expressing tumor cells. CD19 antigen is a B-cell specific cell surface antigen expressed in all B-cell lineage malignancies. Devoid of both ligand binding domains and tyrosine kinase activity, the expressed EGFRt both facilitates in vivo detection of the administered, transduced T-cells and can promote elimination of those cells through a cetuximab-induced antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) response. The 4-1BB costimulatory signaling domain enhances both proliferation of T-cells and antitumor activity.",fdaUniiCode:"7K2YOJ14X0",identifier:"C125192",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Cell",subclassOf:["C129826","C137999","C28681"],synonyms:["Anti-CD19-CAR Genetically Engineered Autologous T Lymphocytes JCAR017","Anti-CD19-CAR Genetically Engineered Autologous T-lymphocytes JCAR017","Autologous Anti-CD19-EGFRt-4-1BB-zeta-modified CAR CD8+ and CD4+ T-lymphocytes JCAR017","Breyanzi","JCAR 017","JCAR017","LISOCABTAGENE MARALEUCEL",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FLisocabtagene_Maraleucel",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Lisocabtagene_Maraleucel","Lisocabtagene Maraleucel","2021-10-30T13:30:30.253Z")));
