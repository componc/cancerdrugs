Upon administration, anti-PD-1\u002FTIM-3 bispecific antibody RO7121661 simultaneously targets and binds to both TIM-3 and PD-1 expressed on certain T-cells. This blocks the interaction of TIM-3 with some of its physiologic ligands and prevents the activation of PD-1 by its ligands, programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) or 2 (PD-L2). This abrogates T-cell inhibition, activates antigen-specific T-lymphocytes and enhances cytotoxic T-cell-mediated tumor cell lysis, which may lead to a reduction in tumor growth. TIM-3, a transmembrane protein and immune checkpoint receptor, is often co-expressed with PD-1 on tumor-antigen-specific T-cells. Dual checkpoint blockade of PD-1 and TIM-3 may enhance T-cell activation and proliferation more than the blockade of either immune checkpoint receptor alone.",fdaUniiCode:"9GAH9VG7IP",identifier:"C160714",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129822","C1454"],synonyms:["Anti-PD-1 x TIM-3 Bispecific Antibody RO7121661","Anti-PD-1\u002FAnti-TIM-3 Bispecific Antibody RO7121661",c,"RO 7121661","RO-7121661","RO7121661"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-PD-1TIM-3_Bispecific_Antibody_RO7121661",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-PD-1TIM-3_Bispecific_Antibody_RO7121661","Anti-PD-1\u002FTIM-3 Bispecific Antibody RO7121661","2021-10-30T13:35:11.123Z")));
