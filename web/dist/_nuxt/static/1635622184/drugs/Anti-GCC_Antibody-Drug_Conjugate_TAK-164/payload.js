Upon intravenous administration of TAK-164, the antibody moiety selectively binds to GCC-expressing cells. Upon antibody\u002Fantigen binding and internalization, the cytotoxic DGN549 payload is released and binds to guanine residues on opposing strands of DNA. This induces DNA strand breaks, inhibits DNA replication, leads to G2\u002FM cell cycle arrest, induces cell death, and inhibits the proliferation of GCC-expressing cells. GCC, a transmembrane receptor normally found on intestinal cells and dopamine neurons in the brain, is overexpressed on the surface of certain tumor cells.",fdaUniiCode:"QCA97P3GSS",identifier:"C156707",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129823","C1512"],synonyms:["Anti-GCC ADC TAK-164",c,"TAK 164","TAK-164","TAK164"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-GCC_Antibody-Drug_Conjugate_TAK-164",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-GCC_Antibody-Drug_Conjugate_TAK-164","Anti-GCC Antibody-Drug Conjugate TAK-164","2021-10-30T13:34:26.433Z")));
