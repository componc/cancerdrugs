Rebastinib binds to and inhibits the Bcr-Abl fusion oncoprotein by changing the conformation of the folded protein to disallow ligand-dependent and ligand-independent activation; in addition, this agent binds to and inhibits Src family kinases LYN, HCK and FGR and the receptor tyrosine kinases TIE-2 and VEGFR-2. Rebastinib may exhibit more potent activity against T315I Bcr-Abl gatekeeper mutant kinases than other Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors. The TIE-2 and VEGFR-2 receptor tyrosine kinases regulate angiogenesis, respectively, while the Src family kinases Abl, LYN, and HCK Src regulate a variety of cellular responses including differentiation, division, adhesion, and the stress response.",fdaUniiCode:"042A5NJE6B",identifier:"C82693",preferredName:b,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C1967"],synonyms:["DCC-2036","DP-1919.TO","REBASTINIB TOSYLATE",b]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FRebastinib_Tosylate",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Rebastinib_Tosylate","Rebastinib Tosylate","2021-10-30T13:46:06.013Z")));
