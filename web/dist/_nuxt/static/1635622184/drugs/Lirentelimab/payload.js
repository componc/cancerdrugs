Upon administration, lirentelimab targets and binds to Siglec-8 expressed on the surface of mast cells and eosinophils. This may inhibit mast cell activation and deplete eosinophils through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and apoptosis. This may reduce abnormal proliferation of mast cells and eosinophils, which plays a key role in allergic and inflammatory responses.",fdaUniiCode:"SWS48LJU3T",identifier:"C129591",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:["AK 002","AK002","LIRENTELIMAB",a,"Monoclonal Antibody AK 002"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FLirentelimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Lirentelimab","","2021-10-30T13:31:12.183Z")));
