Upon oral administration, pimitespib specifically binds to and inhibits the activity of Hsp90 alpha and beta; this results in the proteasomal degradation of oncogenic client proteins, which inhibits client protein dependent-signaling, induces apoptosis, and inhibits the proliferation of cells overexpressing HSP90alpha\u002Fbeta. Hsp90, a family of molecular chaperone proteins that are upregulated in a variety of tumor cells, plays a key role in the conformational maturation, stability, and function of \"client\" proteins within the cell,; many of which are involved in signal transduction, cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, including kinases, cell-cycle regulators, transcription factors and hormone receptors. As TAS-116 selectively inhibits cytosolic HSP90alpha and beta only and does not inhibit HSP90 paralogs, such as endoplasmic reticulum GRP94 or mitochondrial TRAP1, this agent may have less off-target toxicity as compared to non-selective HSP90 inhibitors.",fdaUniiCode:"PLO044MUDZ",identifier:"C134448",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C156880"],synonyms:["3-Ethyl-4-(3-(1-methylethyl)-4-(4-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1H-imidazol-1-yl)-1H-pyrazolo(3,4-b)pyridin-1-yl)benzamide","HSP90alpha\u002Fbeta Inhibitor TAS-116","Heat Shock Protein 90 alpha\u002Fbeta Inhibitor TAS-116","PIMITESPIB",a,"TAS-116","TAS116"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FPimitespib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Pimitespib","","2021-10-30T13:31:48.543Z")));
