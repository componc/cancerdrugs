Upon administration, ivuxolimab selectively binds to and activates OX40; which induces proliferation of memory and effector T-lymphocytes. In the presence of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), this may promote a T-cell-mediated immune response against TAA-expressing tumor cells. OX40, a cell surface glycoprotein and member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF), is expressed on T-lymphocytes and plays an essential role in T-cell activation.",fdaUniiCode:"APS3IS9D6W",identifier:"C121927",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C96040"],synonyms:["Anti-OX40 Agonist Monoclonal Antibody PF-04518600","IVUXOLIMAB",a,"PF-04518600","PF-8600","PF04518600"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FIvuxolimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Ivuxolimab","","2021-10-30T13:29:53.533Z")));
