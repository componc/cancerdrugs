Upon administration, lacutamab binds to KIR3DL2 expressed on certain tumor cells. This recruits natural killer (NK) cells and leads to lysis of KIR3DL2-expressing tumor cells. In addition, IPH4102 induces antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), thereby further eliminating tumor cells. KIR3DL2, a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) and inhibitory receptor of the KIR family, is specifically expressed in most subtypes of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) and expressed only on a fraction of normal NK cells.",fdaUniiCode:"N8O7MY0VNS",identifier:"C124999",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:["Anti-KIR3DL2 Monoclonal Antibody IPH4102","Anti-KIR3DL2 mAb IPH4102","IPH-4102","IPH4102","LACUTAMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FLacutamab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Lacutamab","","2021-10-30T13:30:26.863Z")));
