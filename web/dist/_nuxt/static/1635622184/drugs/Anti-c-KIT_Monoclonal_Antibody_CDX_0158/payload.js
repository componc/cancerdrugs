Upon administration, the anti-c-KIT monoclonal antibody CDX 0158 binds to and inhibits the activation of the cell surface antigen c-Kit. This leads to an inhibition of the activation of c-KIT-mediated signal transduction pathways and inhibits cell proliferation in cancer cells expressing c-Kit. In mast cells, inhibition of c-KIT and c-KIT-mediated signaling prevents mast cell activation, degranulation and subsequent cytokine release. c-Kit, a transmembrane protein and receptor tyrosine kinase, is overexpressed in various cell types, including certain cancer cells and mast cells; it plays a key role in the regulation of cell differentiation and proliferation.",fdaUniiCode:"DF2O3JG5D2",identifier:"C125620",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C163999","C20401"],synonyms:[c,"Anti-c-KIT Monoclonal Antibody KTN0158","CDX 0158","CDX-0158","CDX0158","KTN 0158","KTN-0158","KTN0158"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-c-KIT_Monoclonal_Antibody_CDX_0158",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-c-KIT_Monoclonal_Antibody_CDX_0158","Anti-c-KIT Monoclonal Antibody CDX 0158","2021-10-30T13:30:34.273Z")));
