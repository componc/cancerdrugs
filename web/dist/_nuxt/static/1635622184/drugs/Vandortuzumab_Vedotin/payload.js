Upon administration of vandortuzumab vedotin, the monoclonal antibody moiety of vandortuzumab vedotin binds to STEAP1-expressing tumor cells and is internalized, thereby delivering MMAE intracellularly. Proteolytic cleavage releases MMAE, which then binds to tubulin and inhibits its polymerization, resulting in G2\u002FM phase arrest and tumor cell apoptosis. STEAP1, a tumor-associated antigen (TAA), is overexpressed in a variety of cancer cell types.",fdaUniiCode:"44OUQ00D1U",identifier:"C116748",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C575"],synonyms:["DSTP3086S","MSTP2109A","RG7450","Thio-anti-STEAP1-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE","VANDORTUZUMAB VEDOTIN",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FVandortuzumab_Vedotin",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Vandortuzumab_Vedotin","Vandortuzumab Vedotin","2021-10-30T13:19:15.753Z")));
