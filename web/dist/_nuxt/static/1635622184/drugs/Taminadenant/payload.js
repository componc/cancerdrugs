Upon administration, A2AR antagonist PBF-509 selectively binds to and inhibits A2AR expressed on T-lymphocytes. This abrogates the adenosine\u002FA2AR-mediated inhibition of T-lymphocytes and activates a T-cell-mediated immune response against tumor cells, thereby reducing proliferation of susceptible tumor cells. A2AR, a G protein-coupled receptor, is highly expressed on the cell surfaces of T-cells and, upon activation by adenosine, inhibits their proliferation and activation. Adenosine is often produced in excess by cancer cells.",fdaUniiCode:"84I5UEP321",identifier:"C121664",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C2139"],synonyms:["4-Pyrimidinamine, 5-Bromo-2,6-di-1H-pyrazol-1-yl-","A2AR Antagonist PBF-509","PBF-509","TAMINADENANT",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTaminadenant",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Taminadenant","","2021-10-30T13:20:17.123Z")));
