Upon oral administration, ulixertinib inhibits both ERK 1 and 2, thereby preventing the activation of ERK-mediated signal transduction pathways. This results in the inhibition of ERK-dependent tumor cell proliferation and survival. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)\u002FERK pathway is often upregulated in a variety of tumor cell types and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation, differentiation and survival.",fdaUniiCode:"16ZDH50O1U",identifier:"C104744",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C61074"],synonyms:["1H-Pyrrole-2-carboxamide, 4-(5-chloro-2-((1-methylethyl)amino)-4-pyridinyl)-N-((1S)-1-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl)-","BVD-523","ULIXERTINIB",a,"VRT752271"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FUlixertinib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Ulixertinib","","2021-10-30T13:17:38.153Z")));
