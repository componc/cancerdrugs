Upon oral administration, selonsertib targets and binds to the catalytic kinase domain of ASK1 in an ATP-competitive manner, thereby preventing its phosphorylation and activation. This prevents the phosphorylation of downstream kinases, such as c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). By preventing the activation of ASK1-dependent signal transduction pathways, GS-4997 prevents the production of inflammatory cytokines, down-regulates the expression of genes involved in fibrosis, suppresses excessive apoptosis and inhibits cellular proliferation. ASK1, also called mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 5 (MAP3K5), is activated in response to oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, calcium influx and infection. It plays a key role in the development of certain cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, as well as certain types of cancer.",fdaUniiCode:"NS3988A2TC",identifier:"C121943",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C61074"],synonyms:["GS-4997","SELONSERTIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSelonsertib",extension:".json",createdAt:"2021-10-30T13:29:54.043Z",updatedAt:"2021-10-30T13:29:54.053Z"}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Selonsertib","")));
