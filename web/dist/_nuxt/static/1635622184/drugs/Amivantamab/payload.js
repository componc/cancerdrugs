Upon administration, amivantamab simultaneously targets and binds to wild-type or certain mutant forms of both EGFR and cMet expressed on cancer cells, thereby preventing receptor phosphorylation. This prevents the activation of both EGFR- and cMet-mediated signaling pathways. In addition, binding results in receptor degradation, which further inhibits EGFR- and cMet-mediated signaling. JNJ-61186372 also causes antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Altogether, this results in the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. EGFR and cMet, both upregulated or mutated in a variety of tumor cell types, play key roles in tumor cell proliferation.",fdaUniiCode:"0JSR7Z0NB6",identifier:"C124993",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C1454"],synonyms:["AMIVANTAMAB",a,"Amivantamab-vmjw","Anti-EGFR\u002Fc-Met Bispecific Antibody JNJ-61186372","CNTO-4424","JNJ-611","JNJ-61186372","JNJ61186372",b]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAmivantamab",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Amivantamab","Rybrevant","","2021-10-30T13:30:25.743Z")));
