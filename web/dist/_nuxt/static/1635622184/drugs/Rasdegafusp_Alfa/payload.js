The monoclonal antibody moiety of rasdegafusp alfa1 binds to the endocytic DC receptor, which may result in DC endocytic internalization of this agent, specifically delivering the NY-ESO-1 moiety. DC processing of NY-ESO-1 may boost the immune system to mount a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response (CTL) against cancer cells expressing NY-ESO-1. NY-ESO-1, a cell surface protein expressed in normal fetal and adult testes, is upregulated in a variety of tumor cell types.",fdaUniiCode:"SU9AMV39DB",identifier:"C170362",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C1512","C1663"],synonyms:["CDX-1401","DEC-205\u002FNY-ESO-1 Fusion Protein CDX-1401","RASDEGAFUSP ALFA",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FRasdegafusp_Alfa",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Rasdegafusp_Alfa","","Rasdegafusp Alfa","2021-10-30T13:36:02.213Z")));
