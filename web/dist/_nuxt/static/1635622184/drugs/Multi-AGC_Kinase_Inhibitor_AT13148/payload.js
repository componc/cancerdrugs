AT13148 inhibits, in an ATP-competitive manner, the enzymatic activity of two AGC kinases, protein kinase B (PKB or AKT) and p70S6K which play key roles in the PI3K\u002FPKB\u002FmTOR signaling pathway. Blockade of this pathway leads to an inhibition of cell growth and the induction of apoptosis in susceptible tumor cells. PI3K\u002FPKB\u002FmTOR pathway is dysregulated in greater than 50% of tumors, and is often correlated with resistance and increased tumor survival. AGC group kinases are serine\u002Fthreonine kinases that are regulated by secondary messengers such as cyclic AMP and lipids.",fdaUniiCode:"A49037RP1E",identifier:"C101786",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C61074"],synonyms:["AT-13148","AT13148",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FMulti-AGC_Kinase_Inhibitor_AT13148",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Multi-AGC_Kinase_Inhibitor_AT13148","","Multi-AGC Kinase Inhibitor AT13148","2021-10-30T13:17:04.403Z")));
