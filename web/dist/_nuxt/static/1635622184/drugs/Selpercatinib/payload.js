Upon oral administration, selpercatinib selectively binds to and targets wild-type RET as well as various RET mutants and RET-containing fusion products. This results in an inhibition of cell growth of tumors cells that exhibit increased RET activity. In addition, selpercatinib targets, binds to and inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1) and 3 (VEGFR3), and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), 2 (FGFR2), and 3 (FGFR3).
