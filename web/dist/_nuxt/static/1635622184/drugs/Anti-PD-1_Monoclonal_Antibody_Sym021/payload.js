Upon administration, anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody Sym021 binds to and inhibits PD-1 activation and its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore immune function through the activation of T-cells and cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. PD-1, a transmembrane protein in the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), is expressed on T-cells and functions as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) or 2 (PD-L2). Activated PD-1 plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.",fdaUniiCode:"K45ZNW8WU9",identifier:"C142865",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C128037"],synonyms:[c,"Anti-PD1 Monoclonal Antibody Sym021","SYM-021","Sym021"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-PD-1_Monoclonal_Antibody_Sym021",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-PD-1_Monoclonal_Antibody_Sym021","Anti-PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody Sym021","2021-10-30T13:32:33.773Z")));
