Upon administration, tirabrutinib covalently binds to BTK within B cells, thereby preventing B cell receptor signaling and impeding B cell development. As a result, this agent may inhibit the proliferation of B cell malignancies. BTK, a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase and member of the Tec family of kinases, plays an important role in B lymphocyte development, activation, signaling, proliferation and survival.",fdaUniiCode:"LXG44NDL2T",identifier:"C102876",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C124801","C129825"],synonyms:["6-Amino-9-((3R)-1-(2-butynoyl)-3-pyrrolidinyl)-7-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-7,9-dihydro-8H-purin-8-one","8H-Purin-8-one,6-amino-7,9-dihydro-9-((3R)-1-(1-oxo-2-butyn-1-yl)-3-pyrrolidinyl)-7-(4-phenoxyphenyl)","GS-4059","ONO-4059","ONO4059","TIRABRUTINIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTirabrutinib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Tirabrutinib","","2021-10-30T13:17:16.493Z")));
