Upon administration of simlukafusp alfa, the monoclonal antibody moiety recognizes and binds to FAP, thereby concentrating IL-2 in FAP-expressing tumor tissue. Subsequently, the IL-2 moiety of this fusion protein may stimulate a local immune response and activate natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T-cells. FAP is a cell surface protein that is expressed on a wide variety of cancer cells. IL-2v cannot bind to IL-2 receptor-alpha (CD25, IL2Ra) and does not activate regulatory T-cells (Tregs).",fdaUniiCode:"FL08SGO9XA",identifier:"C129383",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C2139"],synonyms:["Anti-FAP\u002FInterleukin-2 Fusion Protein RO6874281","FAP-IL2v FP RO6874281","FAP-IL2v RO6874281","RG 7461","RG-7461","RG7461","RO 6874281","RO-6874281","RO6874281","SIMLUKAFUSP ALFA",c,"aFAP-IL2v RO6874281"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSimlukafusp_Alfa",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Simlukafusp_Alfa","","Simlukafusp Alfa","2021-10-30T13:31:09.413Z")));
