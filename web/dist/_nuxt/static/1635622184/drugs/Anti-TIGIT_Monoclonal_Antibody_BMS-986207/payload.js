Upon administration, anti-TIGIT monoclonal antibody BMS-986207 binds to TIGIT expressed on various immune cells, particularly on tumor-infiltrating T-lymphocytes (TILs), thereby preventing the interaction of TIGIT with its ligands CD112 (nectin-2; poliovirus receptor related-2; PVRL2) and CD155 (poliovirus receptor; PVR; nectin-like protein 5; NECL-5). This enhances the interaction of CD112 and CD155 with the costimulatory receptor CD226 (DNAX Accessory molecule-1; DNAM-1), which is expressed on immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T-cells, and leads to CD226 dimerization and CD226-mediated signaling. This activates the immune system to exert a T-cell-mediated immune response against cancer cells. TIGIT, a member of the Ig super family and an immune inhibitory receptor, plays a key role in the suppression of T-cell proliferation and activation; it is involved in tumor cell immune evasion, and the inhibition of antiviral immune responses.",fdaUniiCode:"81J55YFQ16",identifier:"C131907",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C134787"],synonyms:[c,"BMS-986207"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-TIGIT_Monoclonal_Antibody_BMS-986207",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-TIGIT_Monoclonal_Antibody_BMS-986207","Anti-TIGIT Monoclonal Antibody BMS-986207","2021-10-30T13:31:29.893Z")));
