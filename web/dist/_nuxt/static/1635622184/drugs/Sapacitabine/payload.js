Sapacitabine is hydrolyzed by amidases to the deoxycytosine analogue CNDAC (2'-Cyano-2'-deoxyarabinofuranosylcytosine), which is then phosphorylated into the active triphosphate form. As an analogue of deoxycytidine triphosphate, CNDAC triphosphate incorporates into DNA strands during replication, resulting in single-stranded DNA breaks during polymerization due to beta-elimination during the fidelity checkpoint process; cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase and apoptosis ensue. The unmetabolized prodrug may exhibit antineoplastic activity as well.",fdaUniiCode:"W335P73C3L",identifier:"C64541",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C1557"],synonyms:["CS-682","CYC682","N-(1-(2-Cyano-2-deoxy-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydropyrimidin-4-yl)-hexadecanamide","SAPACITABINE",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSapacitabine",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Sapacitabine","2021-10-30T13:42:29.383Z")));
