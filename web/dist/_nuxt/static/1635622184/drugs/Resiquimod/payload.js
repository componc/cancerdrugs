Resiquimod exerts its effect through the TLR signaling pathway by binding to and activating TLR7 and 8 mainly on dendritic cells, macrophages, and B-lymphocytes. This induces the nuclear translocation of the transcription activator NF-kB as well as activation of other transcription factors. This may lead to an increase in mRNA levels and subsequent production of cytokines, especially interferon-alpha (INF-a) and other cytokines, thereby enhancing T-helper 1 (Th1) immune responses. In addition, topical application of resiquimod appears to activate Langerhans' cells, leading to an enhanced activation of T-lymphocytes. Due to its immunostimulatory activity, this agent may potentially be useful as a vaccine adjuvant.",fdaUniiCode:"V3DMU7PVXF",identifier:"C63958",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129820"],synonyms:["4-Amino-2-(ethoxymethyl)-alpha,alpha-dimethyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline-1-ethanol","R848","RESIQUIMOD",a,"S 28463","resiquimod"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FResiquimod",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Resiquimod","2021-10-30T13:42:24.903Z")));
