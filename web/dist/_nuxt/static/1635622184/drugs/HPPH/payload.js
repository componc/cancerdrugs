Upon intravenous administration, HPPH selectively accumulates in the cytoplasm of cancer or pre-cancerous cells. When laser light is applied, a photodynamic reaction between HPPH and oxygen occurs, resulting in the production of cytotoxic free radicals and singlet oxygen and free radical-mediated cell death. Compared to the first-generation photosensitizer porfimer sodium, HPPH shows improved pharmacokinetic properties and causes only mild skin photosensitivity which declines rapidly within a few days after administration.",fdaUniiCode:"DOB7Y3RSX0",identifier:"C2636",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C1420"],synonyms:["2-(1-HEXYLOXYETHYL)-2-DEVINYLPYROPHEOPHORBIDE A","2-(1-Hexyloxyethyl)-2-Devinyl Pyropheophorbide-a","2-[1-Hexyloxyethyl]-2-devinyl Pyropheophorbide-alpha",a,"Photochlor"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FHPPH",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("HPPH","","2021-10-30T13:37:56.653Z")));
