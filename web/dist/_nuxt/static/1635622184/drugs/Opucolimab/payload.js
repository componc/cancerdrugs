Upon administration, opucolimab specifically targets and binds to PD-L1, blocking its binding to and activation of its receptor programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; cluster of differentiation 279; CD279). This reverses T-cell inactivation caused by PD-1\u002FPD-L1 signaling and enhances the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated anti-tumor immune response against PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. PD-L1 is overexpressed by many human cancer cell types. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion. PD-1, a transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) expressed on activated T-cells, is a negative regulator of the immune system that limits the expansion and survival of CD8-positive T-cells.",fdaUniiCode:"20ZE3P16HV",identifier:"C165270",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C128057","C129822"],synonyms:["Anti-PD-L1 Monoclonal Antibody HLX20","HLX 20","HLX-20","HLX20","OPUCOLIMAB",a,"PD-L1-targeting Monoclonal Antibody HLX20"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FOpucolimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Opucolimab","","2021-10-30T13:35:43.553Z")));
