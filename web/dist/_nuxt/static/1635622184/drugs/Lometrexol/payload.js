As the 6R diastereomer of 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate, lometrexol inhibits glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), the enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis, arresting cells in the S phase of the cell cycle, and inhibiting tumor cell proliferation.
