In cancer cells, nutlin-3a antagonizes the binding of MDM2 to p53, thereby preventing MDM2-mediated p53 degradation. This results in stabilizing and activating p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The protein MDM2, a negative regulator of p53 activity, is overexpressed in many cancer cell types; the tumor suppressor p53 is mutated or deleted in about 50% of all cancers but active in the other 50%.",fdaUniiCode:"L7C92IOE65",identifier:"C74594",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C162996"],synonyms:["NUTLIN-3A",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FNutlin-3a",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Nutlin-3a","","2021-10-30T13:44:27.003Z")));
