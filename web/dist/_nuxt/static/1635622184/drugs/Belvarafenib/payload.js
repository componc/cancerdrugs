Upon administration, belvarafenib binds to and inhibits the B-Raf mutant V600E and C-Raf. This inhibits B-Raf V600E- and C-Raf-mediated signal transduction pathways, thereby inhibiting tumor cell growth of susceptible tumor cells. In addition, belvarafenib may also inhibit mutated Ras proteins. Raf protein kinases play a key role in the Raf\u002Fmitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)\u002Fextracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, which is often dysregulated in human cancers and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and survival. The Raf mutation B-Raf V600E, where the valine at residue 600 is substituted for glutamic acid, is frequently overexpressed in a variety of human tumors and results in the constitutive activation of the Raf\u002FMEK\u002FERK signaling pathway.",fdaUniiCode:"31M3WLJ3KG",identifier:"C121646",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C2336"],synonyms:["BELVARAFENIB",a,"HM95573"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FBelvarafenib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Belvarafenib","","2021-10-30T13:20:16.183Z")));
