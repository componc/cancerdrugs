Upon administration of mirzotamab clezutoclax, the anti-B7-H3 monoclonal antibody moiety targets and binds to B7-H3 expressed on tumor cells. Upon binding, internalization and linker cleavage, the Bcl-XL inhibitor targets, binds to and inhibits the activity of the pro-survival protein Bcl-XL. This restores apoptotic processes and inhibits the proliferation of B7-H3-expressing tumor cells. B7-H3, a type I transmembrane protein and a member of the B7 co-stimulatory protein superfamily, is overexpressed on certain tumor cell types and on various immune cells. It plays a key role in tumor growth and immune responses.",fdaUniiCode:"TY49T0B03B",identifier:"C157279",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129823","C1512"],synonyms:["ABBV 155","ABBV-155","ABBV155","ADC ABBV-155","Antibody-drug Conjugate ABBV-155","MIRZOTAMAB CLEZUTOCLAX",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FMirzotamab_Clezutoclax",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Mirzotamab_Clezutoclax","","Mirzotamab Clezutoclax","2021-10-30T13:34:36.813Z")));
