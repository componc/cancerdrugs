Varlitinib selectively and reversibly binds to both EGFR (ErbB-1) and Her-2\u002Fneu (ErbB-2) and prevents their phosphorylation and activation, which may result in inhibition of the associated signal transduction pathways, inhibition of cellular proliferation and cell death. EGFR and Her-2 play important roles in cell proliferation and differentiation and are upregulated in various human tumor cell types. Due to the dual inhibition of both EGFR and Her-2, this agent may be therapeutically more effective than agents that inhibit EGFR or Her-2 alone.",fdaUniiCode:"846Y8197W1",identifier:"C62530",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C2167"],synonyms:["ARRY-334543","VARLITINIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FVarlitinib",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Varlitinib","2021-10-30T13:42:12.923Z")));
