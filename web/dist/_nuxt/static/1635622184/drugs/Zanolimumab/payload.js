Zanolimumab targets and binds to the CD4 receptor on certain T-cells thereby preventing the interaction between the CD4 receptor and the major histocompatibility complex class II molecule. This prevents activation of CD4 positive T cells. In addition, zanolimumab is able to induce an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) response against CD4-expressing tumor cells. CD4, a receptor located on a subset of T-lymphocytes, is upregulated in T-cell lymphomas.",fdaUniiCode:"HG3L8885M0",identifier:"C91701",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:["Anti-CD4 Monoclonal Antibody HuMax","HuMax-CD4","ZANOLIMUMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FZanolimumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Zanolimumab","","2021-10-30T13:47:27.783Z")));
