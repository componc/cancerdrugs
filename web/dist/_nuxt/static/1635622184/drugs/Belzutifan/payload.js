Upon oral administration, belzutifan binds to and blocks the function of HIF-2alpha, thereby preventing HIF-2alpha heterodimerization and its subsequent binding to DNA. This results in decreased transcription and expression of HIF-2alpha downstream target genes, many of which regulate hypoxic signaling. This inhibits cell growth and survival of HIF-2alpha-expressing tumor cells. HIF-2alpha, the alpha subunit for the heterodimeric transcription factor HIF-2, is overexpressed in many cancers and promotes tumorigenesis.",fdaUniiCode:"7K28NB895L",identifier:"C135627",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C2189"],synonyms:["BELZUTIFAN",a,"HIF-2alpha Inhibitor PT2977","MK 6482","MK-6482","MK6482","PT2977","Welireg"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FBelzutifan",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Belzutifan","","2021-10-30T13:31:52.823Z")));
