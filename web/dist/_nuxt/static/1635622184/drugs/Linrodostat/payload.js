Upon administration, linrodostat specifically targets and binds to IDO1, a cytosolic enzyme responsible for the oxidation of the amino acid tryptophan into the immunosuppressive metabolite kynurenine. By inhibiting IDO1 and decreasing kynurenine in tumor cells, BMS-986205 restores and promotes the proliferation and activation of various immune cells, including dendritic cells (DCs), natural killer (NK) cells, and T-lymphocytes, and causes a reduction in tumor-associated regulatory T-cells (Tregs). Activation of the immune system, which is suppressed in many cancers, may induce a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against the IDO1-expressing tumor cells, thereby inhibiting the growth of IDO1-expressing tumor cells. IDO1, overexpressed by multiple tumor cell types, plays an important role in immunosuppression. Tryptophan depletion inhibits T-lymphocyte proliferation and activation, and subsequently suppresses the immune system.",fdaUniiCode:"0A7729F42K",identifier:"C141135",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129820","C141137"],synonyms:["(R)-N-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-((1S,4S)-4-(6-fluoroquinolin-4-yl)cyclohexyl)propenamide","BMS 986205","BMS-986205","BMS986205","IDO-1 Inhibitor BMS-986205","Indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-Dioxygenase Inhibitor BMS-986205","LINRODOSTAT",a,"ONO-7701"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FLinrodostat",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Linrodostat","","2021-10-30T13:32:23.303Z")));
