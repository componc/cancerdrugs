The biological activity of this agent is derived from its interferon alpha-2b protein moiety. Interferons alfa bind to specific cell-surface receptors, leading to the transcription and translation of genes whose protein products mediate antiviral, antiproliferative, anticancer, and immune-modulating effects. The PEG moiety lowers the clearance of interferon alpha-2b, thereby extending the duration of its therapeutic effects, but may also reduce the interferon-mediated stimulation of an immune response.",fdaUniiCode:"G8RGG88B68",identifier:"C1845",preferredName:b,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C2491"],synonyms:["PEG Interferon Alpha-2b","PEG Intron","PEG-IFN Alfa-2b","PEG-IFN-a 2b","PEG-Interferon Alfa-2b","PEG-Intron","PEG-interferon alfa-2b","PEGINTERFERON ALFA-2B",b,"Pegylated Interferon Alpha-2b","Polyethylene Glycol IFN-A2b","Polyethylene Glycol Interferon Alfa-2b","SCH 54031","Sylatron"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FPeginterferon_Alfa-2b",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Peginterferon_Alfa-2b","Peginterferon Alfa-2b","2021-10-30T13:36:52.903Z")));
