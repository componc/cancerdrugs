Auora kinase inhibitor MLN8054 binds to and inhibits Aurora kinase A, resulting in disruption of the assembly of the mitotic spindle apparatus, disruption of chromosome segregation, and inhibition of cell proliferation. Aurora A localizes in mitosis to the spindle poles and to spindle microtubules and is thought to regulate spindle assembly. Aberrant expression of Aurora kinases occurs in a wide variety of cancers, including colon and breast cancers.",fdaUniiCode:"BX854EHD63",identifier:"C61075",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C62556"],synonyms:[c,"Benzoic Acid, 4-((9-Chloro-7-(2,6-difluorophenyl)-5H-pyrimido(5,4-d)(2)benzazepin-2-yl)amino)-","MLN 8054","MLN-8054","MLN8054"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAurora_Kinase_Inhibitor_MLN8054",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Aurora_Kinase_Inhibitor_MLN8054","","Aurora Kinase Inhibitor MLN8054","2021-10-30T13:41:17.903Z")));
