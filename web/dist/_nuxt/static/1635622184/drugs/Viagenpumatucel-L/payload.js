Upon administration of viagenpumatucel-L, the irradiated live tumor cells continuously secrete gp96-Ig along with its chaperoned tumor associated antigens (TAAs) into the blood stream, thereby activating antigen presenting cells, natural killer cells and priming potent cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to respond against TAAs on the endogenous tumor cells. Furthermore, this vaccine may induce long-lived memory T cells that could fight recurring cancer cells. gp96-Ig is constructed by replacing the KDEL retention sequence of gp96, normally an endoplasmatic reticulum-resident chaperone peptide, with the Fc portion of mouse and human IgG1.",fdaUniiCode:"13H90KC831",identifier:"C61073",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Immunologic Factor",subclassOf:["C129826","C1983"],synonyms:["Gp96-Ig Fusion Protein-Expressing Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cell Vaccine","HS-110","HS110","VIAGENPUMATUCEL-L",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FViagenpumatucel-L",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Viagenpumatucel-L","","2021-10-30T13:41:17.423Z")));
