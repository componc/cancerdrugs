Upon administration,miptenalimab binds to LAG3 expressed on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and blocks its binding with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules expressed on tumor cells. This activates antigen-specific T-lymphocytes and enhances cytotoxic T-cell-mediated tumor cell lysis, which leads to a reduction in tumor growth. LAG3, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), is expressed on various immune cells, and negatively regulates both proliferation and activation of T-cells. Its expression on TILs is associated with tumor-mediated immune suppression.",fdaUniiCode:"NVCTROPV3P",identifier:"C150403",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C134305"],synonyms:["Anti-LAG3 Monoclonal Antibody BI 754111","Anti-Lymphocyte Activation Gene 3 Protein Monoclonal Antibody BI 754111","BI 754111","BI-754111","BI754111","MIPTENALIMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FMiptenalimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Miptenalimab","","2021-10-30T13:33:22.823Z")));
