Upon administration of denintuzumab mafodotin, the antibody moiety targets the cell surface antigen CD19, found on a number of B-cell-derived cancers. Upon antibody\u002Fantigen binding and internalization, the immunoconjugate releases MMAF, which binds to tubulin and inhibits its polymerization. Inhibition of tubulin polymerization may result in G2\u002FM phase arrest and tumor cell apoptosis. This causes inhibition of cell growth of CD19-expressing tumor cells. CD19, a B-cell antigen, is overexpressed by a variety of different cancer cell types.",fdaUniiCode:"H5324S1M7H",identifier:"C105150",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129823","C1512"],synonyms:["ADC SGN-19A","DENINTUZUMAB MAFODOTIN",c,"Immunoglobulin G1-kappa Auristatin F Conjugate, Anti-(homosapiens CD19 (B Lymphocyte Surface Antigen B4, leu-12)), Humanized Monoclonal Antibody","SGN-19A","SGN-CD19A"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FDenintuzumab_Mafodotin",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Denintuzumab_Mafodotin","","Denintuzumab Mafodotin","2021-10-30T13:17:40.713Z")));
