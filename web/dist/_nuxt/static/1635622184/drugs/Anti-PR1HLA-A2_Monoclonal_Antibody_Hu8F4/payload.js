Upon administration, anti-PR1\u002FHLA-A2 monoclonal antibody Hu8F4 selectively binds to a combined epitope of the PR1\u002FHLA-A2 complex expressed on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts and leukemic stem cells (LSC), and prevents PR1\u002FHLA-A2-mediated signaling. This induces complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), to a lesser extent, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), and CDC\u002FADCC-independent cytolysis of myeloid leukemia cells. This results in a reduction of cellular proliferation in PR1\u002FHLA-A2-overexpressing leukemic cells.
