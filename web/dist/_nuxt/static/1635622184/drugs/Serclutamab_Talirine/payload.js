Upon intravenous administration of serclutamab talirine, the serclutamab moiety targets and binds to EGFR on tumor cell surfaces. Following receptor internalization and lysosome-mediated cleavage, talirine is released. In turn, the imine groups of the PBD moiety bind to the N2 positions of guanines on opposite strands of DNA. This induces DNA strand breaks, inhibits DNA replication, leads to G2\u002FM cell cycle arrest, induces cell death, and inhibits the proliferation of EGFR-overexpressing tumor cells. EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that is overexpressed by a variety of cancers, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and survival.",fdaUniiCode:"7W0O278T12",identifier:"C150590",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129823","C1512"],synonyms:["ABBV 321","ABBV-321","ABBV321","ADC ABBV-321","Anti-EGFR\u002FPBD ADC ABBV-321","SERCLUTAMAB TALIRINE",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSerclutamab_Talirine",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Serclutamab_Talirine","","Serclutamab Talirine","2021-10-30T13:33:24.753Z")));
