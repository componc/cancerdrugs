Sonolisib inhibits the production of the secondary messenger phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) and activation of the PI3K\u002FAkt signaling pathway, which may result in inhibition of tumor cell growth and survival in susceptible tumor cell populations. Activation of the PI3K\u002FAkt signaling pathway is frequently associated with tumorigenesis and dysregulated PI3K\u002FAkt signaling may contribute to tumor resistance to a variety of antineoplastic agents.",fdaUniiCode:"987796874T",identifier:"C78848",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C2152"],synonyms:["(4E)-4-(((Bis(prop-2-en-1-yl)amino)methylidene)-6-hydroxy-1alpha-(methoxymethyl)-3,7,17-trioxo-2-oxaandrosta-5,8-dien-11alpha-yl Acetate","PX 866","PX-866","PX866","SONOLISIB",a,"acetic acid (1S,4E,10R,11R,13S,14R)-4-diallylaminomethylene-6-hydroxy-1-methoxymethyl-10,13-dimethyl-3,7,17-trioxo-1,3,4,7,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17-dodecahydro-2-oxa-cyclopenta[a]phenanthren-11-yl ester","acetic acid 4-diallylaminomethylene-6-hydroxy-1-alpha 12-methoxymethyl-10beta,13beta-dimethyl-3,7,17-trioxo-1,3,4,7,10,11beta,12,13,14alpha,15,16,17-dodecahydro-2-oxa-cyclopenta[a]phenanthren-11-yl ester"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSonolisib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Sonolisib","","2021-10-30T13:45:20.353Z")));
