HER3, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of receptor tyrosine kinases, is frequently overexpressed in solid tumors, including breast, lung, and colorectal tumors of epithelial origin; it has no active kinase domain itself but is activated through heterodimerization with other members of the EGFR receptor family that do.",fdaUniiCode:"86780VJI1Q",identifier:"C78853",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C20401"],synonyms:["AMG 888","PATRITUMAB",a,"U3-1287"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FPatritumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Patritumab","","2021-10-30T13:45:20.843Z")));
