ABT-737 binds to the hydrophobic groove of multiple members of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein family, including Bcl-2, Bcl-xl and Bcl-w. This inhibits the activity of these pro-survival proteins and restores apoptotic processes in tumor cells, via activation of Bak\u002FBax-mediated apoptosis. The pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins are overexpressed in many cancers and play important roles in the regulation of apoptosis. Their expression is associated with increased drug resistance and tumor cell survival. ABT-737 does not inhibit the pro-survival proteins Mcl-1, Bcl-B, Bfl-1 (A1); therefore, tumors that overexpress these Bcl-2 family proteins are resistant to ABT-737.",fdaUniiCode:"Z5NFR173NV",identifier:"C114384",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129839"],synonyms:["ABT-737",c,"Benzamide, 4-(4-((4'-Chloro(1,1'-biphenyl)-2-yl)methyl)-1-piperazinyl)-n-((4-(((1r)-3-(dimethylamino)-1-((phenylthio)methyl)propyl)amino)-3-nitrophenyl)sulfonyl)-"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FBH3_Mimetic_ABT-737",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","BH3_Mimetic_ABT-737","BH3 Mimetic ABT-737","2021-10-30T13:18:46.313Z")));
