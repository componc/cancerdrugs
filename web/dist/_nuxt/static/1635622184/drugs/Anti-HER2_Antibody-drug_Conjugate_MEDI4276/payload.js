Upon administration of ADC MEDI4276, the anti-HER2 bispecific antibody specifically targets and binds to HER2 on the surface of certain cancer cells. Upon binding, crosslinking and internalization of antibody-HER2 complexes occurs and MEDI4276 is transported to the lysosome where the linker is cleaved, thereby delivering tubulysin inside HER2-expressing cancer cells. Tubulysin binds to tubulin and inhibits microtubule polymerization, which blocks cell division. This results in G2\u002FM phase arrest, tumor cell apoptosis, and decreased proliferation of HER2-expressing tumor cells. HER2, a tyrosine kinase receptor, is overexpressed by many cancer cell types.",fdaUniiCode:"ZAM3L34SEW",identifier:"C126355",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C155712"],synonyms:["ADC MEDI4276",c,"MEDI-4276","MEDI4276"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-HER2_Antibody-drug_Conjugate_MEDI4276",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-HER2_Antibody-drug_Conjugate_MEDI4276","Anti-HER2 Antibody-drug Conjugate MEDI4276","2021-10-30T13:30:42.863Z")));
