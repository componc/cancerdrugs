Upon administration, valecobulin is converted into its active metabolite S-516 that binds to tubulin and prevents its polymerization in tumor blood vessel endothelial cells and tumor cells. This blocks the formation of the mitotic spindle and leads to cell cycle arrest at the G2\u002FM phase. As a result, this agent disrupts the tumor vasculature and tumor blood flow, deprives tumor cells of nutrients and induces tumor cell apoptosis. In addition, this agent has a direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells by inhibiting tubulin polymerization.",fdaUniiCode:"P48P97V001",identifier:"C101264",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C25974"],synonyms:["(S)-N-(4-(3-(1H-1,2,4-Triazol-1-yl)-4-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl)phenyl)thiazol-2-yl)-2-amino-3-methylbutanamide Hydrochloride","CKD-516","Tubulin Polymerization Inhibitor CKD-516","VALECOBULIN",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FValecobulin",extension:".json",createdAt:"2021-10-30T13:16:59.953Z",updatedAt:"2021-10-30T13:16:59.963Z"}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Valecobulin","")));
