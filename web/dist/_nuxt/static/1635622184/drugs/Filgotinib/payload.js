Upon oral administration, filgotinib specifically targets, binds to, and inhibits the phosphorylation of JAK1, which interferes with JAK\u002FSTAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription)-dependent signaling. As JAK1 mediates signaling of many pro-inflammatory cytokines, JAK1 inhibition prevents cytokine signaling and activity in many inflammatory and immune-mediated processes and leads to a decrease in inflammation and activation of certain immune cells. JAK1 plays a key role in the signaling and activity of many cytokines and growth factors and is often dysregulated in a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, as well as some malignancies.",fdaUniiCode:"3XVL385Q0M",identifier:"C155799",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C1967"],synonyms:["FILGOTINIB",a,"GLPG 0634","GLPG0634","GS-6034"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FFilgotinib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Filgotinib","","2021-10-30T13:34:13.153Z")));
