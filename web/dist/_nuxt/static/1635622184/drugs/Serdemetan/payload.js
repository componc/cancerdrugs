Serdemetan inhibits the binding of the HDM2 protein to the transcriptional activation domain of the tumor suppressor protein p53. By preventing this HDM2-p53 interaction, the proteasome-mediated enzymatic degradation of p53 is inhibited, which may result in the restoration of p53 signaling and thus the p53-mediated induction of tumor cell apoptosis. HDM2 (human homolog of double minute 2), a zinc finger protein, is a negative regulator of the p53 pathway; often overexpressed in cancer cells, it has been implicated in cancer cell proliferation and survival.",fdaUniiCode:"ID6YB4W3V8",identifier:"C77904",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129839"],synonyms:["JNJ 26854165","JNJ-26854165","N-(2-(1H-Indol-3-yl)ethyl)-n'-(pyridin-4-yl)benzene-1,4-diamine","SERDEMETAN",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSerdemetan",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Serdemetan","","2021-10-30T13:44:59.773Z")));
