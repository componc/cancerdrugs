Upon administration, cirmtuzumab binds to ROR1 and blocks ROR1-mediated signaling. This prevents tumor cell proliferation in cancer cells overexpressing ROR1. ROR1, also known as neurotrophic tyrosine kinase, receptor-related 1 (NTRKR1), is normally expressed during embryogenesis.  It is overexpressed in certain leukemias and solid tumors, but minimally expressed in healthy cells.",fdaUniiCode:"FEH7RQ7B3J",identifier:"C118284",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C20401"],synonyms:["CIRMTUZUMAB",a,"UC-961"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FCirmtuzumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Cirmtuzumab","","2021-10-30T13:19:39.103Z")));
