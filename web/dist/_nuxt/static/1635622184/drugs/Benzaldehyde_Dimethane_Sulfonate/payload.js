Although the exact mechanism of action has yet to be fully elucidated, benzaldehyde dimethane sulfonate alkylates DNA, which results in DNA double strand breaks, inhibition of DNA replication, cell cycle arrest and cell death. In addition, this agent is metabolized by the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) into the active carboxylic acid metabolite benzoic acid dimethane sulfonate (BA), which further contributes to its alkylating activity. Unlike other alkylating agents, benzaldehyde dimethane sulfonate has demonstrated antitumor activity in renal cell carcinoma.",fdaUniiCode:"96B0BRI1JU",identifier:"C107164",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C1590"],synonyms:["BEN",c,"DMS-612","DMS612","NSC 281612"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FBenzaldehyde_Dimethane_Sulfonate",extension:".json",createdAt:"2021-10-30T13:18:00.833Z",updatedAt:"2021-10-30T13:18:00.843Z"}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Benzaldehyde_Dimethane_Sulfonate","Benzaldehyde Dimethane Sulfonate")));
