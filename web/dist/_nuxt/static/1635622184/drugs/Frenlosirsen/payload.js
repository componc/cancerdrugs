Upon intravenous administration, frenlosirsen hybridizes with IRF4 mRNA, which blocks translation of the IRF4 protein. Reduction of IRF4 levels prevents the expression of IRF4-controlled tumor promoter genes, and may enhance tumor cell apoptosis and prevent T-cell exhaustion. IRF4, a transcription factor expressed in lymphocytes and essential for plasma cell differentiation, is involved in immune cell development and plays a key role in T-cell functions. It is overexpressed in certain tumor cell types and is a key regulator of multiple genes controlling tumor cell survival.",fdaUniiCode:"J2Y9QT3BWL",identifier:"C173725",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Nucleic Acid, Nucleoside, or Nucleotide",subclassOf:["C1291"],synonyms:["Anti-IRF4 ASO ION251","Anti-IRF4 ASO IONIS-IRF4-2.5Rx","Anti-IRF4 Antisense Oligonucleotide ION251","FRENLOSIRSEN",a,"ION 251","ION-251","ION251","IONIS-IRF4-2.5Rx","ON-935918"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FFrenlosirsen",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Frenlosirsen","","2021-10-30T13:36:20.073Z")));
