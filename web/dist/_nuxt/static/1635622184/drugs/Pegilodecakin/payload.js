Upon subcutaneous administration, pegilodecakin may activate cell-mediated immunity against cancer cells by stimulating the differentiation and expansion of tumor specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. This agent may also lower serum cholesterol levels and reduce atherosclerotic plaques by inhibiting the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as Interferon-gamma, IL-2, IL-3, TNF-alpha, and GM-CSF. The PEG moiety inhibits proteolytic breakdown and clearance of AM0010, which prolongs its half-life, extends the duration of its therapeutic effects and allows less frequent dosing.",fdaUniiCode:"5Z9850I25F",identifier:"C113295",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C1320"],synonyms:["AM-0010","AM0010","PEG-rHuIL-10 AM0010","PEGILODECAKIN",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FPegilodecakin",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Pegilodecakin","","2021-10-30T13:18:33.903Z")));
