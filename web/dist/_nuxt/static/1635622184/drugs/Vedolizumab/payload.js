Upon administration, vedolizumab selectively binds to integrin a4b7 and prevents the binding of a4b7, expressed on the surface of a subset of T-lymphocytes, to its natural ligand, mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1), which is mainly expressed on the surface of gut endothelial cells. This prevents a4b7-mediated signaling, adhesion of lymphocytes to the endothelium and the migration of T-lymphocytes across the endothelium into inflamed gastrointestinal (GI) tissue. By preventing this infiltration to the affected area, inflammation is reduced. The human lymphocyte a4b7 integrin, plays a key role in gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation; it is overexpressed in certain types of cancer cells. The alpha4beta7\u002FMAdCAM-1 signaling pathway plays a critical role in the homing of T-lymphocytes to intestinal tissue.",fdaUniiCode:"9RV78Q2002",identifier:"C95798",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C20401"],synonyms:[b,"Immunoglobulin G1, Anti-(Human Integrin LPAM-1 (Lymphocyte Peyer's Patch Adhesion Molecule 1)) (Human-Mus musculus Heavy Chain), Disulfide with Human-Mus musculus kappa-chain, Dimer","Immunoglobulin G1, anti-(human integrin LPAM-1 (lymphocyte Peyer's patch adhesion molecule 1)) (human-Mus musculus heavy chain), disulfide with human-Mus musculus kappa-chain, dimer","LDP 02","LDP-02","LDP02","MLN0002","MLN02","VEDOLIZUMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FVedolizumab",extension:".json",createdAt:e,updatedAt:e}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Vedolizumab","Entyvio","vedolizumab","","2021-10-30T13:48:14.183Z")));
