Upon oral administration,  zorifertinib binds to and inhibits the activity of EGFR as well as certain mutant forms of EGFR. This prevents EGFR-mediated signaling, and may lead to both induction of cell death and inhibition of tumor growth in EGFR-overexpressing cells. EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase mutated in many tumor cell types, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization.",fdaUniiCode:"67SX9H68W2",identifier:"C118289",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C2167"],synonyms:["AZD3759","ZORIFERTINIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FZorifertinib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Zorifertinib","","2021-10-30T13:19:39.563Z")));
