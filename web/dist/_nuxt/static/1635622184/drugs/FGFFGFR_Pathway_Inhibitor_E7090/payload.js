Upon administration, the FGF\u002FFGFR pathway inhibitor E7090 selectively interferes with the binding of FGF to FGFR through an as of yet not fully elucidated mechanism. This inhibits FGFR-mediated signaling and leads to both cell proliferation inhibition and cell death in FGFR-overexpressing tumor cells. FGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase essential to tumor cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival; its expression is upregulated in many tumor cell types.",fdaUniiCode:"TN7CUD1NGA",identifier:"C118672",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C1967"],synonyms:["E-7090","E7090",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FFGFFGFR_Pathway_Inhibitor_E7090",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","FGFFGFR_Pathway_Inhibitor_E7090","FGF\u002FFGFR Pathway Inhibitor E7090","2021-10-30T13:19:45.703Z")));
