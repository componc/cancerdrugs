This may result in a reduction of angiogenesis and a reduction in cell growth of Efnb2 and\u002For EphB4 over-expressing tumor cells. In addition, this agent also prevents the angiogenic effects of numerous growth factors due to interactions between Efnb2 and EphB4. Efnb2 and EphB4 are overexpressed in a variety of tumor cell types; the bi-directional signaling of Efnb2-EphB4 plays an important role in angiogenesis and tumor cell migration, invasion, and proliferation. Albumin reduces this agent's degradation, improves circulation time and may thus improve efficacy.",fdaUniiCode:"SO0RV2V6EJ",identifier:"C102569",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C1742"],synonyms:[c,"SEPHB4-HSA","sEphB4-HSA"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FRecombinant_EphB4-HSA_Fusion_Protein",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Recombinant_EphB4-HSA_Fusion_Protein","Recombinant EphB4-HSA Fusion Protein","2021-10-30T13:17:10.093Z")));
