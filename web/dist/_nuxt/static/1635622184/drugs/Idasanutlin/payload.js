Idasanutlin binds to MDM2 blocking the interaction between the MDM2 protein and the transcriptional activation domain of the tumor suppressor protein p53. By preventing the MDM2-p53 interaction, p53 is not enzymatically degraded and the transcriptional activity of p53 is restored. This may lead to p53-mediated induction of tumor cell apoptosis. MDM2, a zinc finger nuclear phosphoprotein and negative regulator of the p53 pathway, is often overexpressed in cancer cells and has been implicated in cancer cell proliferation and survival.",fdaUniiCode:"QSQ883V35U",identifier:"C99131",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C162996"],synonyms:["IDASANUTLIN",a,"RG-7388","RG7388","RO-5503781","RO5503781"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FIdasanutlin",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Idasanutlin","","2021-10-30T13:48:59.973Z")));
