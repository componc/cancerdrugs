Upon administration, retifanlimab binds to and inhibits PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore immune function through the activation of T-cells and cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. PD-1, a transmembrane protein in the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) expressed on T-cells, functions as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) or 2 (PD-L2); it plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.",fdaUniiCode:"2Y3T5IF01Z",identifier:"C142168",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C128037","C129822"],synonyms:["INCMGA 0012","INCMGA-0012","INCMGA00012","INCMGA0012","MGA 012","MGA-012","MGA012","RETIFANLIMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FRetifanlimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Retifanlimab","","2021-10-30T13:32:28.713Z")));
