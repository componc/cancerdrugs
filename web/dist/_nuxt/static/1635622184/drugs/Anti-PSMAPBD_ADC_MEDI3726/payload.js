Upon administration of anti-PSMA\u002FPBD ADC MEDI3726, the antibody moiety targets the cell surface antigen PSMA, which is found on prostate cancer cells. Upon antibody\u002Fantigen binding, internalization and lysosome-mediated cleavage of the dipeptide linker, the cytotoxic PBD moiety is released. In turn, the imine groups of the PBD moiety bind to the N2 positions of guanines on opposite strands of DNA. This induces DNA strand breaks, inhibits DNA replication, leads to G2\u002FM cell cycle arrest, induces cell death, and inhibits the proliferation of PSMA-overexpressing tumor cells. PSMA is overexpressed by prostate cancers; its expression is associated with poor prognosis and metastasis.",fdaUniiCode:"SA4H7K0SW2",identifier:"C140552",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129823","C176017"],synonyms:["ADC MEDI3726","ADCT 401","ADCT-401","ADCT401",c,"MEDI 3726","MEDI-3726","MEDI3726"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-PSMAPBD_ADC_MEDI3726",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-PSMAPBD_ADC_MEDI3726","Anti-PSMA\u002FPBD ADC MEDI3726","2021-10-30T13:32:21.183Z")));
