Upon administration, AG-120 specifically inhibits a mutated form of IDH1 in the cytoplasm, which inhibits the formation of the oncometabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). This may lead to both an induction of cellular differentiation and an inhibition of cellular proliferation in IDH1-expressing tumor cells. IDH1, an enzyme in the citric acid cycle, is mutated in a variety of cancers; it initiates and drives cancer growth by both blocking cell differentiation and catalyzing the formation of 2HG.",fdaUniiCode:"Q2PCN8MAM6",identifier:"C114383",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C168618"],synonyms:["AG-120","IVOSIDENIB",a,b]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FIvosidenib",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Ivosidenib","Tibsovo","","2021-10-30T13:18:45.843Z")));
