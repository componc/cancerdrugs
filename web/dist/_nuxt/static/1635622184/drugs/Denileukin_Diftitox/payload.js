The IL-2 protein sequence moiety of denileukin difitox directs the cytocidal action of diphtheria toxin to cells that express IL-2 receptors. After the toxin moiety is internalized into target IL-2 receptor-expressing cells, its catalytic domain catalyzes the transfer of the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD to a posttranslationally modified histidine residue of elongation factor 2 (EF-2), called diphthamine. This covalent modification inactivates EF-2 and disrupts polypeptide chain elongation, resulting in cell death.",fdaUniiCode:"25E79B5CTM",identifier:"C1476",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C575"],synonyms:["DAB(389)-Interleukin-2","DAB(389)IL-2","DAB389 Interleukin-2","DAB389 Interleukin-2 Immunotoxin","DAB389IL-2","DAB389IL2","DENILEUKIN DIFTITOX",c,"Interleukin-2 Fusion Protein","Interleukin-2 Fusion Toxin","LY335348","Ontak","denileukin diftitox"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FDenileukin_Diftitox",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Denileukin_Diftitox","","Denileukin Diftitox","2021-10-30T13:32:56.333Z")));
