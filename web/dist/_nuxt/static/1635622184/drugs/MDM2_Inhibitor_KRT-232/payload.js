Upon oral administration, MDM2 inhibitor KRT-232 binds to the MDM2 protein and prevents its binding to the transcriptional activation domain of the tumor suppressor protein p53. By preventing this MDM2-p53 interaction, the transcriptional activity of p53 is restored. This leads to p53-mediated induction of tumor cell apoptosis. MDM2, a zinc finger protein and a negative regulator of the p53 pathway, is overexpressed in cancer cells; it plays a key role in cancer cell proliferation and survival.",fdaUniiCode:"7R7G6EH5UL",identifier:"C116624",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C162996"],synonyms:["(3R,5R,6S)-5-(3-Chlorophenyl)-6-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-methyl-1-((1S)-2-methyl-1-(((1-methylethyl)sulfonyl)methyl)propyl)-2-oxo-3-piperidineacetic Acid","AMG 232","AMG-232","KRT 232","KRT-232","KRT232",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FMDM2_Inhibitor_KRT-232",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("MDM2_Inhibitor_KRT-232","","MDM2 Inhibitor KRT-232","2021-10-30T13:19:09.523Z")));
