Upon oral administration, P-p68 inhibitor RX-5902 may both inhibit the activity of the anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) protein and facilitate the induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (p21). This may prevent G2\u002FM cell cycle progression and lead to growth inhibition in tumor cells. P-p68 is overexpressed in various types of solid tumors but absent in normal tissues, and plays a role in tumor progression and metastasis. p21 is a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor which regulates cell cycle progression and mediates both growth arrest and cellular senescence.",fdaUniiCode:"ZU8OM8V5WF",identifier:"C113293",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C471"],synonyms:[c,"RX-5902","SUPINOXIN","Supinoxin"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FP-p68_Inhibitor_RX-5902",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","P-p68_Inhibitor_RX-5902","P-p68 Inhibitor RX-5902","2021-10-30T13:18:33.373Z")));
