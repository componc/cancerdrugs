As an immunostimulatory sequence (ISS) that signals through Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), ISS 1018 CpG ODN induces the production of immunoglobulin by B cells and interferon (IFN) -alpha, IFN-beta, interleukin (IL) -12, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC). pDC, through cell-cell contact, and IFN-alpha and -beta, in turn, induce natural killer (NK) cell proliferation, NK cell production of IFN-gamma, and NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity; secreted IFNs also stimulate bystander T cell activation and differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into T-helper 1 cells on specific antigen challenge. In addition, ISS 1018 CpG ODN promotes antigen presentation and co-stimulatory molecule expression.",fdaUniiCode:"25DT549L0G",identifier:"C61080",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Nucleic Acid, Nucleoside, or Nucleotide",subclassOf:["C2139","C2164"],synonyms:["1018 ISS","CPG 1018","DNA, D(P-THIO)(T-G-A-C-T-G-T-G-A-A-C-G-T-T-C-G-A-G-A-T-G-A)",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FISS_1018_CpG_Oligodeoxynucleotide",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","ISS_1018_CpG_Oligodeoxynucleotide","ISS 1018 CpG Oligodeoxynucleotide","2021-10-30T13:41:18.383Z")));
