Upon administration, aprutumab binds to and inhibits FGFR2, which may result in the inhibition of both FGFR2 phosphorylation and FGFR2-mediated signal transduction pathways. This results in the inhibition of cell proliferation and the induction of cell death of FGFR2-expressing tumor cells. FGFR2, upregulated in many tumor cell types, is a receptor tyrosine kinase, which is essential to tumor cellular proliferation, differentiation and survival.",fdaUniiCode:"GK8781218Z",identifier:"C107683",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C133879"],synonyms:["AGC-2500","APRUTUMAB",a,"BAY-1179470","BAY1179470"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAprutumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Aprutumab","","2021-10-30T13:18:06.143Z")));
