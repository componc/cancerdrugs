The L19 moiety of L19-IL2 monoclonal antibody-cytokine fusion protein binds to the ED-B domain of fibronectin on tumor cells in the tumor neovasculature. In turn, the IL-2 moiety may locally activate natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages, and may induce T cell cytotoxic immune responses against ED-B fibronectin-expressing tumor cells. This may specifically decrease the proliferation of ED-B-expressing tumor cells. ED-B is predominantly expressed during angiogenesis and tumor growth.",fdaUniiCode:"2OQ3OPV2F8",identifier:"C90546",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C1512"],synonyms:["DARLEUKIN",a,"L19-IL2","L19-IL2 Monoclonal Antibody-Cytokine Fusion Protein"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FDarleukin",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Darleukin","","2021-10-30T13:47:06.583Z")));
