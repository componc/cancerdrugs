Upon administration, anti-fucosyl-GM1 monoclonal antibody BMS-986012 binds to fucosyl-GM1 on cancer cells and may activate both antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity against the bound tumor cells. This may inhibit the proliferation of GM1-expressing tumor cells.
