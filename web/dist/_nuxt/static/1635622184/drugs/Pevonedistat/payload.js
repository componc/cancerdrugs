Pevonedistat binds to and inhibits NAE, which may result in the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and survival. NAE activates Nedd8 (Neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 8), an ubiquitin-like (UBL) protein that modifies cellular targets in a pathway that is parallel to but distinct from the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP). Functioning in diverse regulatory activities, proteins conjugated to UBLs like Nedd8 typically are not targeted for proteasomal degradation.",fdaUniiCode:"S3AZD8D215",identifier:"C77906",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C129825"],synonyms:["((1S,2S,4R)-4-(4-((1S)-2,3-Dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylamino)-7H-pyrrolo(2,3-d)pyrimidin-7-yl)-2-hydroxycyclopentyl)methyl Sulphamate","MLN4924","Nedd8-Activating Enzyme Inhibitor MLN4924","PEVONEDISTAT",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FPevonedistat",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Pevonedistat","","2021-10-30T13:45:00.233Z")));
