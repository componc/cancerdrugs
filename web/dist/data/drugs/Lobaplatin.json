    "definition": "A third-generation, water-soluble platinum compound with potential antineoplastic activity. Lobaplatin forms highly reactive, charged, platinum complexes that bind to nucleophilic groups such as GC- and AG-rich sites in DNA, inducing intrastrand DNA cross-links. These cross-links will ultimately result in induction of apoptosis and cell growth inhibition. Compared to first and second generation platinum compounds, lobaplatin appears to be more stable, less toxic, have a better therapeutic index and may overcome tumor resistance.",
