    "definition": "A monoclonal antibody against myostatin (MSTN) with potential anti-cachexia activity. Upon administration,  landogrozumab binds to and neutralizes the MSTN protein, thereby blocking the MSTN signalling pathway. This may help decrease muscle protein breakdown and muscle weakness and may attenuate cancer cachexia. MSTN, a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, is a negative regulator of muscle growth and development.",
