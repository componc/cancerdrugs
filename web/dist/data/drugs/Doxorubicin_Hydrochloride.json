Assess LVEF before and regularly during and after treatment with doxorubicin [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Secondary Malignancies: Secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) occur at a higher incidence in patients treated with anthracyclines, including doxorubicin [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Extravasation and Tissue Necrosis: Extravasation of doxorubicin can result in severe local tissue injury and necrosis requiring wide excision of the affected area and skin grafting.Immediately terminate the drug, and apply ice to the affected area [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )].

    "definition": "The hydrochloride salt of doxorubicin, an anthracycline antibiotic with antineoplastic activity. Doxorubicin, isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius, is the hydroxylated congener of daunorubicin. Doxorubicin intercalates between base pairs in the DNA helix, thereby preventing DNA replication and ultimately inhibiting protein synthesis. Additionally, doxorubicin inhibits topoisomerase II which results in an increased and stabilized cleavable enzyme-DNA linked complex during DNA replication and subsequently prevents the ligation of the nucleotide strand after double-strand breakage. Doxorubicin also forms oxygen free radicals resulting in cytotoxicity secondary to lipid peroxidation of cell membrane lipids; the formation of oxygen free radicals also contributes to the toxicity of the anthracycline antibiotics, namely the cardiac and cutaneous vascular effects.",
