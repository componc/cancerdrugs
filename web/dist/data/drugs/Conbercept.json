    "definition": "A recombinant, soluble, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) protein composed of the second immunoglobulin (Ig) domain of VEGFR-1, the third and fourth Ig domains of VEGFR-2, and the constant region (Fc) of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) with potential anti-angiogenic activities. Upon intravitreal injection, conbercept, functioning as a soluble decoy receptor, binds with high affinity to all VEGF-A isoforms, VEGF-B, as well as placenta growth factor (PlGF)-1 and PlGF-2. This prevents the binding of these growth factors to their endogenous receptors, potentially inhibiting angiogenesis and tumor cell growth.",
