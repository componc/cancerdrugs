For patients at low-risk for fracture, consider drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use ( 1.6 ) 1.1 Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women Zoledronic acid injection is indicated for treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, diagnosed by bone mineral density (BMD) or prevalent vertebral fracture, zoledronic acid injection reduces the incidence of fractures (hip, vertebral and non-vertebral osteoporosis-related fractures).

In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, diagnosed by bone mineral density (BMD) or prevalent vertebral fracture, zoledronic acid injection reduces the incidence of fractures (hip, vertebral and non-vertebral osteoporosis-related fractures). In patients at high risk of fracture, defined as a recent low-trauma hip fracture, zoledronic acid injection reduces the incidence of new clinical fractures [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. 1.2 Prevention of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women Zoledronic acid injection is indicated for prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women [ see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. 1.3 Osteoporosis in Men Zoledronic acid injection is indicated for treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis [ see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. 1.4 Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis Zoledronic acid injection is indicated for the treatment and prevention of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men and women who are either initiating or continuing systemic glucocorticoids in a daily dosage equivalent to 7.5 mg or greater of prednisone and who are expected to remain on glucocorticoids for at least 12 months [ see Clinical Studies (14.4) ]. 1.5 Paget's Disease of Bone Zoledronic acid injection is indicated for treatment of Paget's disease of bone in men and women. Treatment is indicated in patients with Paget\u2019s disease of bone with elevations in serum alkaline phosphatase of two times or higher than the upper limit of the age-specific normal reference range, or those who are symptomatic, or those at risk for complications from their disease [ see Clinical Studies (14.5) ]. 1.6 Important Limitations of Use The safety and effectiveness of zoledronic acid injection for the treatment of osteoporosis is based on clinical data of three years duration. The optimal duration of use has not been determined. All patients on bisphosphonate therapy should have the need for continued therapy re-evaluated on a periodic basis. Patients at low-risk for fracture should be considered for drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use. Patients who discontinue therapy should have their risk for fracture re-evaluated periodically.

    "definition": "A synthetic imidazole bisphosphonate analog of pyrophosphate with anti-bone-resorption activity. A third-generation bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid binds to hydroxyapatite crystals in the bone matrix, slowing their dissolution and inhibiting the formation and aggregation of these crystals. This agent also inhibits farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, an enzyme involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. Inhibition of this enzyme prevents the biosynthesis of isoprenoid lipids, donor substrates of farnesylation and geranylgeranylation during the post-translational modification of small GTPase signalling proteins, which are important in the process of osteoclast turnover. Decreased bone turnover and stabilization of the bone matrix contribute to the analgesic effect of zoledronic acid with respect to painful osteoblastic lesions. The agent also reduces serum calcium concentrations associated with hypercalcemia.",
