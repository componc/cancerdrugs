    "definition": "An orally bioavailable imidazopyridazine and inhibitor of Janus kinase 2 mutant V617F (JAK2V617F), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, gandotinib selectively and competitively inhibits the activation of JAK2V617F, which may result in the inhibition of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and the induction of apoptosis in JAK2V617F-expressing tumor cells. JAK2V617F has a substitution of phenylalanine for valine at amino acid position 617 and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and survival.",
