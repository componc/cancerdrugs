    "definition": "A formulation comprised of a prodrug form of the benzothiazole derivative riluzole, with potential anti-depressant, anxiolytic and antineoplastic activities. Following oral administration, troriluzole is converted into the active form riluzole. While the mechanism of action of riluzole is unknown, its pharmacological activities, some of which may be related to its effect, include the following: 1) an inhibitory effect on glutamate release, 2) inactivation of voltage-dependent sodium channels, and 3) interference with intracellular events that follow transmitter binding at excitatory amino acid receptors. These activities may result in myorelaxation and sedation due to the blockade of glutamatergic neurotransmission. Additionally, these activities may result in the inhibition of enzymes that are necessary for cell growth, which may decrease tumor cell growth and metastasis.",
