    "definition": "A fully human agonistic monoclonal antibody to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor-1 (TRAIL-R1) with apoptosis promoting and potential antitumor activities. TRAIL-R1 is a cell surface receptor expressed on many malignant cell types. Mapatumumab selectively binds to and activates the TRAIL cell receptor, thereby inducing apoptosis and reducing tumor growth.",
