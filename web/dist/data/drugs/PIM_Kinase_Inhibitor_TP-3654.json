    "definition": "An orally available, second-generation and selective ATP-competitive inhibitor of proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus (PIM) kinases, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, PIM kinase inhibitor TP-3654 selectively binds to and prevents the activation of the PIM kinases. This prevents the activation of PIM-mediated signaling pathways and inhibits proliferation in cells that overexpress PIM. PIMs, constitutively active proto-oncogenic serine/threonine kinases, are upregulated in various types of cancers and play key roles in tumor cell proliferation and survival.",
