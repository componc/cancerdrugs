    "definition": "A chimeric recombinant IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against human CD20 with potential antineoplastic activity. Ublituximab specifically binds to the B cell-specific cell surface antigen CD20, thereby potentially inducing a B cell-directed complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against CD20-expressing B cells, leading to B cell apoptosis. CD20 is a non-glycosylated cell surface phosphoprotein that is exclusively expressed on B cells during most stages of B cell development and is often overexpressed in B-cell malignancies. Ublituximab has a specific glycosylation profile, with a low fucose content, that may enhance its ADCC response against malignant B cells.",
