    "definition": "An orally bioavailable thromboxane (TxA2) and prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) (TP) receptor antagonist, with anti-thrombotic, anti-hypertensive, anti-asthmatic and potential anti-metastatic activities. Upon administration, ifetroban targets and binds to TxA2 and PGH2 receptors, thereby preventing the activity of both TxA2 and PGH2 and disrupting their downstream signaling pathways. This prevents platelet activation, aggregation and thrombosis. It also prevents vascular constriction and causes vasodilation. In addition, as cancer cells use platelets to metastasize to different parts of the body, ifetroban can reduce the stickiness of the platelets and prevent metastasis. TxA2 causes vascular contraction and platelet activation.",
