    "definition": "A human IgG1k monoclonal antibody against the CD4 receptor on T-lymphocytes, with potential antineoplastic and immunosuppressing activities. Zanolimumab targets and binds to the CD4 receptor on certain T-cells thereby preventing the interaction between the CD4 receptor and the major histocompatibility complex class II molecule. This prevents activation of CD4 positive T cells. In addition, zanolimumab is able to induce an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) response against CD4-expressing tumor cells. CD4, a receptor located on a subset of T-lymphocytes, is upregulated in T-cell lymphomas.",
