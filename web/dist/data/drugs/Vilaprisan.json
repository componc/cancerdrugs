    "definition": "An orally available progestin and selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM), with potential anti-progesterone and antineoplastic activities. Upon oral administration, vilaprisan competitively binds to the progesterone receptor (PR) in progesterone-responsive tissue and inhibits PR-mediated gene expression. This interferes with progesterone activity in the reproductive system and may inhibit PR-mediated proliferative effects in cells overexpressing PRs. As a result, this agent may suppress ovulation and inhibit proliferation of endometrial tissue or uterine fibroid formation.",
