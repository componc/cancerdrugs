    "definition": "A small-molecule wortmannin analogue inhibitor of the alpha, gamma, and delta isoforms of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) with potential antineoplastic activity. Sonolisib inhibits the production of the secondary messenger phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) and activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which may result in inhibition of tumor cell growth and survival in susceptible tumor cell populations. Activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is frequently associated with tumorigenesis and dysregulated PI3K/Akt signaling may contribute to tumor resistance to a variety of antineoplastic agents.",
