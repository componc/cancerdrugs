    "definition": "The trifluoroacetate (TFA) salt form of teverelix, a synthetic decapeptide and antagonist of the naturally occurring gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), with potential hormone production inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, teverelix directly competes with GnRH for receptor binding in the anterior pituitary gland, thereby inhibiting GnRH receptor signaling. This inhibits the secretion and release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). In males, the inhibition of LH secretion prevents the release of testosterone. Since testosterone is required to sustain prostate growth, reducing testosterone levels may inhibit hormone-dependent prostate cancer cell proliferation. In females, this prevents the production of estrogen by the ovaries and may relieve symptoms from sex-hormone dependent diseases.",
