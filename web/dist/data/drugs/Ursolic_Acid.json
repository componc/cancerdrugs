    "definition": "A pentacyclic triterpenoid found in various fruits, vegetables and medicinal herbs, with a variety of potential pharmacologic activities including anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, antiviral, serum lipid-lowering, and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, ursolic acid may promote apoptosis and inhibit cancer cell proliferation through multiple mechanisms. This may include the regulation of mitochondrial function through various pathways including the ROCK/PTEN and p53 pathways, the suppression of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) pathways, and the increase in caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 activities.",
