    "definition": "A fully human monoclonal antibody against killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, lirilumab binds to KIR, thereby preventing the binding of KIR ligands to KIR on natural killer (NK) cells. By blocking these inhibitory receptors, NK cells become activated and attack cancer cells leading to tumor cell death. KIR, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is expressed on the surface of NK cells.",
