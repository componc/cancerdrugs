    "definition": "A preparation of a defined ratio of CD4+ and CD8+ autologous T-lymphocytes transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) containing an anti-CD19 single chain variable fragment (scFv) fused to the signaling domain of 4-1BB (CD137), the zeta chain of the TCR/CD3 complex (CD3-zeta), and a truncated form of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRt), with potential immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon intravenous administration, lisocabtagene maraleucel is directed to and induces selective toxicity in CD19-expressing tumor cells. CD19 antigen is a B-cell specific cell surface antigen expressed in all B-cell lineage malignancies. Devoid of both ligand binding domains and tyrosine kinase activity, the expressed EGFRt both facilitates in vivo detection of the administered, transduced T-cells and can promote elimination of those cells through a cetuximab-induced antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) response. The 4-1BB costimulatory signaling domain enhances both proliferation of T-cells and antitumor activity.",
