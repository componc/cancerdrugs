    "definition": "An orally bioavailable inhibitor of a variety of kinases, including the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, the mast/stem cell growth factor receptor Kit (c-Kit), the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt (protein kinase B), and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) with antineoplastic activity. Upon administration,olverembatinib targets, binds to and inhibits the kinase activities of Bcr-Abl, AKT, c-Kit and ERK. This inhibits their mediated signaling pathways and inhibits proliferation of tumor cells in which these kinases are overexpressed and/or mutated. Bcr-Abl, c-Kit, AKT and ERK play key roles in the proliferation, differentiation and survival of tumor cells.",
