    "definition": "An orally available dual kinase inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinase anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, ALK-FAK inhibitor CEP-37440 selectively binds to and inhibits ALK kinase and FAK kinase. The inhibition leads to disruption of ALK- and FAK-mediated signal transduction pathways and eventually inhibits tumor cell growth in ALK- and FAK-overexpressing tumor cells. ALK belongs to the insulin receptor superfamily and plays an important role in nervous system development; its dysregulation and gene rearrangements are associated with a variety of tumors. The cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase FAK, a signal transducer for integrins, is upregulated and constitutively activated in various tumor types; it plays a key role in tumor cell migration, proliferation, survival, and tumor angiogenesis.",
