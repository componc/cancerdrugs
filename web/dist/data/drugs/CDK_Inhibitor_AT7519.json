    "definition": "An orally bioavailable small molecule with potential antineoplastic activity. AT7519M selectively binds to and inhibits cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs), which may result in cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. CDKs are serine/threonine kinases involved in regulation of the cell cycle and may be overexpressed in some types of cancer cells.",
