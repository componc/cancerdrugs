    "definition": "A human bispecific antibody targeting both epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR; cMet), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, amivantamab simultaneously targets and binds to wild-type or certain mutant forms of both EGFR and cMet expressed on cancer cells, thereby preventing receptor phosphorylation. This prevents the activation of both EGFR- and cMet-mediated signaling pathways. In addition, binding results in receptor degradation, which further inhibits EGFR- and cMet-mediated signaling. JNJ-61186372 also causes antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Altogether, this results in the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. EGFR and cMet, both upregulated or mutated in a variety of tumor cell types, play key roles in tumor cell proliferation.",
