    "definition": "A vinca alkaloid compound and semi-synthetic vincristine derivative with antineoplastic activity. Vinepidine binds to and stabilizes tubulin, thereby preventing tubulin polymerization and depolymerization, which result in microtubule assembly and disassembly, respectively. Treated cells are unable to complete mitosis process and are arrested in the metaphase, thereby leading to an inhibition of cell growth.",
