    "definition": "A chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody against human mesothelin with potential anti-tumor activity. Amatuximab specifically targets mesothelin, a cell surface glycoprotein involved in cell adhesion and overexpressed on many epithelial-derived cancer cells. Upon binding to the mesothelin antigen, amatuximab triggers an antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)-mediated host immune response against mesothelin-expressing cells, resulting in cell lysis.",
