    "definition": "A 2-cyanoaziridine derivative with antitumor activity in multiple myeloma.  Although its mechanism of action is not clearly known, imexon may induce apoptosis via a pathway involving cleaved caspase-3, caspase-9, and/or caspase-8.  Other cytotoxic mechanisms of action of this agent may involve thiol depletion, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and decreases in the mitochondrial membrane potential.",
