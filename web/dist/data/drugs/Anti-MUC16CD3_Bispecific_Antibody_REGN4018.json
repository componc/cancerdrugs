    "definition": "A bispecific, human monoclonal antibody with potential antineoplastic activity. REGN4018 contains two antigen-recognition sites: one for human CD3, a T cell surface antigen that is part of the T cell receptor complex, and one for human mucin 16 (MUC16, cancer antigen 125; CA125; FLJ14303), a member of the mucin family of glycoproteins that is overexpressed by several epithelial cancers, including ovarian cancer. Upon administration, REGN4018 binds to both T-cells and MUC16-expressing tumor cells, which cross-links the T-cells to the tumor cells, and may result in a potent cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against the MUC16-expressing tumor cells.",
