    "definition": "A human, agonistic immunoglobulin (Ig) G2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting 4-1BB (CD137, TNFRSF9), with potential immunostimulating activity. Upon administration, utomilumab binds to and activates 4-1BB expressed on various immune cells, such as CD8-positive and CD4-positive T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. This enhances 4-1BB-mediated signaling, induces cytokine production and promotes anti-tumor immune responses. 4-1BB, a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)/nerve growth factor (NGF) family of receptors, plays an important role in the regulation of immune responses.",
