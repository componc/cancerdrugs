    "definition": "A carbohydrate-based immunostimulant comprised of the Globo H hexasaccharide 1 (Globo H) epitope linked to the immunostimulant carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration of adagloxad simolenin, the carbohydrate antigen Globo H may stimulate a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against Globo H-expressing tumor cells, thereby decreasing tumor cell proliferation. Globo H is a tumor associated antigen (TAA) commonly found on a variety of tumor cells including breast cancer cells. KLH improves antigenic immune recognition and T-cell responses.",
