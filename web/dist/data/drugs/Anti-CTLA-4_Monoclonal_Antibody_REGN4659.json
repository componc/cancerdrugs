    "definition": "A fully human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody directed against the human T-cell-expressed receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4; CTLA-4), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon intravenous administration, anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody REGN4659 targets and binds to CTLA-4 expressed on T-cells and inhibits the CTLA-4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation. This leads to a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against cancer cells. CTLA-4, an inhibitory receptor and member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), plays a key role in the downregulation of the immune system.",
