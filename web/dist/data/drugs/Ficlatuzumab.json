    "definition": "A humanized monoclonal antibody directed against human hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) with potential antineoplastic activity. Ficlatuzumab binds to the soluble ligand HGF, preventing the binding of HGF to its receptor c-Met and activation of the HGF/c-Met signaling pathway, which may result in cell death in c-Met-expressing tumor cells. c-Met, a receptor tyrosine kinase overexpressed or mutated in many tumor cell types, plays a key role in cancer cell growth, survival, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis.",
