    "definition": "The hydrochloride salt form of nemorubicin, a morpholinyl analogue of the anthracycline doxorubicin with antineoplastic activity. Nemorubicin is metabolized via the P450 CYP3A enzyme to a highly cytotoxic derivative. Unlike most anthracyclines, nemorubicin is a topoisomerase I inhibitor and appears to exert its effect through the nucleotide excision repair (NER) system. In addition, this agent does not show cross-resistance with other anthracyclines.",
