    "definition": "A cancer vaccine consisting of autologous dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with autologous, lethally irradiated cancer cells and mixed with the cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), with potential immunostimulatory and antineoplastic activities. Upon vaccination, ovapuldencel-T may stimulate the immune system to exert a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) immune response against the repertoire of tumor associated antigens (TAAs) found in the irradiated cancer cells. GM-CSF enhances the activation of dendritic cells (DCs) and promotes antigen presentation to both B- and T-lymphocytes.",
