    "definition": "The anhydrous form of docetaxel, a semisynthetic side-chain analogue of paclitaxel with antineoplastic property. Docetaxel binds specifically to the beta-tubulin subunit of microtubules and thereby antagonizes the disassembly of the microtubule proteins. This results in the persistence of aberrant microtubule structures and results in cell-cycle arrest and subsequent cell death.",
