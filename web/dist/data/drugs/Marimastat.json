    "definition": "An orally-active synthetic hydroxamate with potential antineoplastic activity.  Marimastat covalently binds to the zinc(II) ion in the active site of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), thereby inhibiting the action of MMPs, inducing extracellular matrix degradation, and inhibiting angiogenesis, tumor growth and invasion, and metastasis.  This agent may also inhibit tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme (TACE), an enzyme involved in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) production that may play a role in some malignancies as well as in the development of arthritis and sepsis.",
