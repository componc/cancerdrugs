    "definition": "A humanized monoclonal antibody against the immune receptor human killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor, three domains, long cytoplasmic tail, 2 (KIR3DL2), with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, lacutamab binds to KIR3DL2 expressed on certain tumor cells. This recruits natural killer (NK) cells and leads to lysis of KIR3DL2-expressing tumor cells. In addition, IPH4102 induces antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), thereby further eliminating tumor cells. KIR3DL2, a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) and inhibitory receptor of the KIR family, is specifically expressed in most subtypes of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) and expressed only on a fraction of normal NK cells.",
