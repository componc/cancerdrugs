    "definition": "An orally available inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) types 1 and 2, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, fluzoparib inhibits PARP 1 and 2 activity, which inhibits PARP-mediated repair of damaged DNA via the base excision repair (BER) pathway, enhances the accumulation of DNA strand breaks, promotes genomic instability, and leads to an induction of apoptosis. The PARP family of proteins catalyze post-translational ADP-ribosylation of nuclear proteins, which then transduce signals to recruit other proteins to repair damaged DNA. PARP inhibition may enhance the cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging agents and may reverse tumor cell chemoresistance and radioresistance.",
