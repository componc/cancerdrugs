    "definition": "A monoclonal antibody directed against the ganglioside fucosyl-GM1, with potential antineoplastic and immunomodulating activities. Upon administration, anti-fucosyl-GM1 monoclonal antibody BMS-986012 binds to fucosyl-GM1 on cancer cells and may activate both antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity against the bound tumor cells. This may inhibit the proliferation of GM1-expressing tumor cells. Fucosyl-GM1, a sphingolipid monosialoganglioside and tumor associated antigen (TAA), is overexpressed on the surface of many cancer cells while its expression is minimal or non-existent in normal tissues.",
