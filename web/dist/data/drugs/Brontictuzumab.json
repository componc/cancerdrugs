    "definition": "A humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the Notch-1 receptor with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, brontictuzumab binds to Notch-1 on the cell surface, thereby inhibiting Notch-mediated signaling and tumor cell proliferation. Notch 1, a type 1 transmembrane protein belonging to the Notch family, functions as a receptor for membrane bound ligands and has various roles during development; dysregulated Notch signaling is associated with increased cell growth and chemoresistance in cancers.",
