    "definition": "An analogue of consensus interferon which contains an additional methionyl amino acid residue.  Consensus interferon (also known as interferon alfacon-1, rCon-IFN, and CIFN) is a genetically engineered synthetic interferon created from the most common amino acid sequences from the naturally occurring alpha interferons.  Alpha interferons bind to specific cell-surface receptors, resulting in the transcription and translation of genes whose protein products have antiviral, antiproliferative, anticancer, and immune-modulating effects.",
