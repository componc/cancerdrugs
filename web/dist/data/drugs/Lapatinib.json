The patients in the registration study had not previously been treated with trastuzumab or an aromatase inhibitor. No data are available on the efficacy of this combination relative to trastuzumab in combination with an aromatase inhibitor in this patient population.",

    "definition": "A synthetic, orally-active quinazoline with potential antineoplastic properties. Lapatinib reversibly blocks phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), ErbB2, and the Erk-1 and-2 and AKT kinases; it also inhibits cyclin D protein levels in human tumor cell lines and xenografts. EGFR and ErbB2 have been implicated in the growth of various tumor types.",
