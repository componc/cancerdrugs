    "definition": "The succinate salt form of epitinib, an orally available epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, epitinib inhibits the activity of EGFR, thereby preventing EGFR-mediated signaling. This may lead to induction of cell death and inhibition of tumor growth in EGFR-overexpressing tumor cells. EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that is overexpressed in certain tumor types and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and vascularization.",
