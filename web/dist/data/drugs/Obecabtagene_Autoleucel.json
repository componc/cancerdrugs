    "definition": "A preparation of autologous T-lymphocytes that have been genetically modified and transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing a second-generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), CAT-41BBz CAR, targeting the tumor-associated antigen (TAA) CD19, with potential immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, obecabtagene autoleucel target and bind to CD19-expressing tumor cells. This results in a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against CD19-expressing tumor cells and tumor cell lysis. CD19, cluster of differentiation 19, is a B-cell-specific cell surface antigen overexpressed in B-cell lineage tumors. The CAT-41BBz CAR has a faster off-rate compared with FMC63-41BBz CAR. This may minimize cytokine release and reduce toxicities, and enhance persistence of the CAR T-cells.",
