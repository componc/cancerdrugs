      "indication": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE PEGINTRON is an antiviral indicated for treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C (CHC) in patients with compensated liver disease. ( 1.1 ) 1.1 Chronic Hepatitis C (CHC) PEGINTRON \u00ae , as part of a combination regimen, is indicated for the treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C (CHC) in patients with compensated liver disease. PEGINTRON in combination with ribavirin and an approved Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease inhibitor is indicated in adult patients with HCV genotype 1 infection (see labeling of the specific HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor for further information). PEGINTRON in combination with ribavirin is indicated in patients with genotypes other than 1, pediatric patients (3-17 years of age), or in patients with genotype 1 infection where use of an HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor is not warranted based on tolerability, contraindications or other clinical factors. PEGINTRON monotherapy should only be used in the treatment of CHC in patients with compensated liver disease if there are contraindications to or significant intolerance of ribavirin and is indicated for use only in previously untreated adult patients. Combination therapy provides substantially better response rates than monotherapy [see Clinical Studies (14.1 , 14.2) ] .",

    "definition": "A covalent conjugate of recombinant interferon alpha, subtype 2b, and polyethylene glycol (PEG), used as an antiviral and antineoplastic agent. The biological activity of this agent is derived from its interferon alpha-2b protein moiety. Interferons alfa bind to specific cell-surface receptors, leading to the transcription and translation of genes whose protein products mediate antiviral, antiproliferative, anticancer, and immune-modulating effects. The PEG moiety lowers the clearance of interferon alpha-2b, thereby extending the duration of its therapeutic effects, but may also reduce the interferon-mediated stimulation of an immune response.",
