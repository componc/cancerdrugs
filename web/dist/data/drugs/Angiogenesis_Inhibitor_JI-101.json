    "definition": "An orally active inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRb), and the ephrin B4 receptor B4 (EphB4) with potential antiangiogenic and antineoplastic activities. Angiogenesis inhibitor JI-101 binds to and inhibits VEGFR2, PDGFRb and EphB4, which may inhibit tumor angiogenesis and, so, cellular proliferation in tumor cells overexpressing VEGFR2, PDGFRb and EphB4. The receptor tyrosine kinases VEGFR2, PDGFRb and EphB4 may be overexpressed in a number of different cancer cell types and may play crucial roles in tumor angiogenesis.",
