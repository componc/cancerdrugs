    "definition": "An inhibitor of induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (myeloid cell leukemia-1; Mcl-1; Bcl2-L-3), with potential pro-apoptotic and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, MCL-1 inhibitor AMG 397 targets and binds to Mcl-1, thereby preventing the binding of Mcl-1 to and inactivation of certain pro-apoptotic proteins. This promotes apoptosis of cells overexpressing Mcl-1. Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic protein belonging to the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family of proteins, is upregulated in cancer cells and promotes tumor cell survival.",
