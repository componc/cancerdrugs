    "definition": "An orally bioavailable inhibitor of the menin-mixed lineage leukemia (MLL; myeloid/lymphoid leukemia; KMT2A) fusion protein, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, menin-MLL interaction inhibitor KO 539 prevents the interaction between the two proteins menin and MLL, and thus the formation of the menin-MLL complex. This reduces the expression of downstream target genes and results in an inhibition of the proliferation of MLL-rearranged leukemic cells. The menin-MLL complex plays a key role in the survival, growth and proliferation of certain kinds of leukemia cells.",
