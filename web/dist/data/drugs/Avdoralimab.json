    "definition": "A human monoclonal antibody targeting the C5a receptor (C5aR), with potential immunomodulating activity.  Upon administration, avdoralimab specifically targets, binds to and blocks C5aR expressed on subsets of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and neutrophils. This prevents the binding of its ligand C5a to C5aR and prevents the C5aR-mediated activation and accumulation of these cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), and abrogates the secretion of inflammatory and angiogenic factors by these cells. This results in the activation of T- and natural killer (NK) cells, the induction of anti-tumor immune responses and inhibits tumor cell proliferation. C5a, a factor in the complement cascade, is often overexpressed in tumors, where it attracts and activates MDSCs and neutrophils in the TME.",
