    "definition": "A recombinant human monoclonal antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory human cell surface receptor programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; PD1), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, sintilimab binds to PD-1 and inhibits the binding of PD-1 to the PD-1 ligands programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), and PD-1 ligand 2 (PD-L2). This prevents the activation of PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore immune function through the activation of both T-cells and T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. PD-1, a transmembrane protein in the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily expressed on activated T-cells, negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands; it plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.",
