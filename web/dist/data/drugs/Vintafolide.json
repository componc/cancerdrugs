    "definition": "A water-soluble, folate-receptor-targeted conjugate of folate and the vinca alkaloid desacetylvinblastine monohydrazide (DAVLBH) with potential antineoplastic activity. The folate moiety of vintafolide binds to folic acid receptors on the tumor cell surface and the agent is internalized via folate receptor-mediated endocytosis, delivering the tubulin-binding DAVLBH moiety directly into the tumor cell; DAVLBH binding to tubulin results in the disruption of microtubule assembly-disassembly dynamics, cell cycle arrest, and tumor cell apoptosis. Folic acid receptors are frequently upregulated on the surfaces of many tumor cell types. DAVLBH is a derivative of the natural product vinblastine.",
