    "definition": "A pegylated form of a thermostable and protease resistant peptide targeting human vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) with potential antiangiogenic activity. Derived from the 10th type III domain of human fibronectin and one of the natural ligands, pegdinetanib binds to VEGFR-2 and prevents activation of VEGFR-2 by other activating ligands. This may inhibit the growth of new tumor blood vessels.",
