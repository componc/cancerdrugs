    "definition": "An orally bioavailable synthetic peptide containing the amino acids D-glutamine and L-tryptophan connected by a gamma-glutamyl linkage with potential immunostimulating, antimicrobial and antineoplastic activities. Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, golotimod appears to inhibit the expression of STAT-3, reversing immunosuppression and stimulating an anti-tumor immune response. This agent may stimulate the production of T-lymphocytes, in particular the helper T (Th1) cells, activate macrophages, and increase levels of interleukin 2 and interferon gamma. STAT-3, a transcription factor upregulated in many cancer cell types, is involved in tumor cell growth and survival and immunosuppression.",
