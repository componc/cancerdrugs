See full prescribing information for digoxin. Digoxin Injection, for intravenous or intramuscular use Initial U.S. Approval: 1954 INDICATIONS AND USAGE 1.1 Heart Failure in Adults Digoxin is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate heart failure in adults. Digoxin increases left ventricular ejection fraction and imporves heart failure symptoms, as evidenced by improves heart failure symptoms, as evidenced by improved exercise capacity and decreased heart failure-related hospitalizations and emergency care, while having no effect on mortality. Where possible, digoxin should be used in combination with a diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. 1.2 Atrial Fibrillation in Adults Digoxin is indicated for the control of ventricular response rate in adult patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside indicated for: Treatment of mild to moderate heart failure in adults. (1.1) Control of resting ventricular rate in adults with chronic artial fibrillation. (1.2)",

This agent also acts directly on the atrioventricular node to suppress conduction, thereby slowing conduction velocity.  Apparently due to its effects on intracellular calcium concentrations, digoxin induces apoptosis of tumor cells via a pathway involving mitochondrial cytochrome c and caspases 8 and 3.",
