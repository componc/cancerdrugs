    "definition": "A monoclonal antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory human cell surface receptor programmed cell death 1 protein (PD-1, PCDC-1), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, cetrelimab binds to PD-1, and inhibits the interaction with its ligands, programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1, PD-1L1) and PD-1 ligand 2 (PD-L2, PD-1L2). The inhibition of ligand binding prevents PD-1-mediated signaling and results in both T-cell activation and the induction of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. PD-1, an immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily transmembrane protein and inhibitory receptor, negatively regulates T-cell activation.",
