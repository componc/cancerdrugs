    "definition": "An agent that inhibits P-cadherin (cdh3), with potential antineoplastic activity. PF-03732010 binds to and inhibits the activity of p-cadherin. Inhibition of the activity of p-cadherin may inhibit tumor cell invasion and proliferation in p-cadherin expressing tumor cells. P-cadherin, a cell-surface protein and member of the cadherin family, is overexpressed in a variety of solid tumors, and plays a role in cell adhesion, motility, invasion and proliferation.",
