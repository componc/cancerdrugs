    "definition": "A benzopyridoindole derivative with antineoplastic property. Intoplicine inhibits activities of both topoisomerase I and II via intercalating DNA helix, thereby hindering the movements of enzymes along DNA molecules during DNA transcription and replication, respectively. Furthermore, this agent stabilizes DNA-enzyme complexes during unwinding processes by both topoisomerases, leading to double- and single-stranded DNA breaks. Consequently, these effects bring about cell growth inhibition and apoptosis of tumor cells.",
