    "definition": "An orally active alkyl-phosphocholine compound with potential antineoplastic activity.  Targeting cellular membranes, perifosine modulates membrane permeability, membrane lipid composition, phospholipid metabolism, and mitogenic signal transduction, resulting in cell differentiation and inhibition of cell growth.  This agent also inhibits the anti-apoptotic mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and modulates the balance between the MAPK and pro-apoptotic stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK/JNK) pathways, thereby inducing apoptosis.  Perifosine has a lower gastrointestinal toxicity profile than the related agent miltefosine.",
