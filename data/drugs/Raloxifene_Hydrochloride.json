The effect in the reduction in the incidence of breast cancer was shown in a study of postmenopausal women at high risk for breast cancer with a 5-year planned duration with a median follow-up of 4.3 years [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . Twenty-seven percent of the participants received drug for 5 years. The long-term effects and the recommended length of treatment are not known. High risk of breast cancer is defined as at least one breast biopsy showing lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) or atypical hyperplasia, one or more first-degree relatives with breast cancer, or a 5-year predicted risk of breast cancer \u2265 1.66% (based on the modified Gail model). Among the factors included in the modified Gail model are the following: current age, number of first-degree relatives with breast cancer, number of breast biopsies, age at menarche, nulliparity or age of first live birth. Healthcare professionals can obtain a Gail Model Risk Assessment Tool by dialing 1-800-545-5979. Currently, no single clinical finding or test result can quantify risk of breast cancer with certainty. After an assessment of the risk of developing breast cancer, the decision regarding therapy with raloxifene hydrochloride tablets should be based upon an individual assessment of the benefits and risks. Raloxifene hydrochloride tablets does not eliminate the risk of breast cancer. Patients should have breast exams and mammograms before starting raloxifene hydrochloride tablets and should continue regular breast exams and mammograms in keeping with good medical practice after beginning treatment with raloxifene hydrochloride tablets. Important Limitations of Use for Breast Cancer Risk Reduction There are no data available regarding the effect of raloxifene hydrochloride tablets on invasive breast cancer incidence in women with inherited mutations (BRCA1, BRCA2) to be able to make specific recommendations on the effectiveness of raloxifene hydrochloride tablets. Raloxifene hydrochloride tablets are not indicated for the treatment of invasive breast cancer or reduction of the risk of recurrence. Raloxifene hydrochloride tablets are not indicated for the reduction in the risk of noninvasive breast cancer.",

    "definition": "The hydrochloride salt form of raloxifene, a selective benzothiophene estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) with lipid lowering effects and activity against osteoporosis. Raloxifene hydrochloride specifically binds to estrogen receptors in responsive tissue, including liver, bone, breast, and endometrium. The resulting ligand-receptor complex is translocated to the nucleus where, depending on the tissue type, it promotes or suppresses the transcription of estrogen-regulated genes, thereby exerting its agonistic or antagonistic effects. This agent functions as an estrogen agonist in lipid metabolism, thereby decreasing total and LDL cholesterol levels. In tissue like bone, it decreases bone resorption and bone turnover and increases bone mineral density. Raloxifene hydrochloride acts as an estrogen antagonist in uterine and breast tissue. This agent also exerts an anti-proliferative effect on estrogen-sensitive breast cancer.",
