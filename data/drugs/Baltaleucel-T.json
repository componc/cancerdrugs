    "definition": "A preparation of autologous Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs), which have specific reactivity to the EBV antigens, latent membrane proteins (LMP) 1 (LMP1) and 2 (LMP2), EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) and BamHI-A rightward frame-1 (BARF1), with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, baltaleucel-T targets and binds to EBV-expressing cancer cells specifically expressing the targeted antigens. This may kill LMP1/LMP2/EBNA/BARF1-expressing EBV-associated cancer cells. LMP1, LMP2, EBNA and BARF1 are tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) that are specifically associated with EBV infection, and play key roles in the proliferation of a variety of tumors.",
