    "definition": "An orally available protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor with potential immunosuppressive and antineoplastic activities. Upon oral administration, darovasertib inds to and inhibits PKC, which prevents the activation of PKC-mediated signaling pathways. This may lead to the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in susceptible tumor cells. PKC, a serine/threonine protein kinase overexpressed in certain types of cancer cells, is involved in tumor cell differentiation, proliferation, invasion and survival.",
