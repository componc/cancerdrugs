    "definition": "A monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against human transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta; TGFb), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, anti-TGF-beta monoclonal antibody SAR-439459 specifically targets and binds to TGF-beta, thereby preventing the activation of TGF-beta-mediated signaling pathways. This may inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells in which TGF-beta is overactivated. TGF-beta, a pro-inflammatory mediator that is mutated and/or overexpressed in a variety of cancer cell types, is involved in cancer cell proliferation and migration, and in tumor progression.",
