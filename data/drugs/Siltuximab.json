    "definition": "A chimeric, human-murine, monoclonal antibody targeting the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6), with antitumor and anti-inflammatory activities. Upon intravenous administration of siltuximab, this agent targets and binds to IL-6. This inhibits the binding of IL-6 to the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), which results in the blockade of the IL-6/IL-6R-mediated signal transduction pathway. This inhibits cancer cell growth in tumors overexpressing IL-6.",
