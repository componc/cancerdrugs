    "definition": "A polyether antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces conglobatus sp. nov. Trejo with antineoplastic activity.  Ionomycin is a calcium ionophore that increases intracellular Ca++ levels, possibly relating to endonuclease activation of lymphocytes and decreased ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax and ultimately apoptosis.  In addition, this agent is used to investigate the role of intracellular calcium in cellular processes. (NCI)",
