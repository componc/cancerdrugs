    "definition": "A humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the WNT antagonist dickkopf homolog 1 (DKK1), with potential anti-osteolytic activity. Upon administration, DKK1-neutralizing monoclonal antibody DKN-01 binds to and inhibits DKK1, thereby restoring signaling through the WNT pathway, which may result in osteoblast differentiation and activation within the bone matrix and the reversal of tumor-induced osteolytic disease. DKK1, overexpressed by certain cancer cells, is an inhibitor of the WNT signaling pathway and prevents the mediated formation of bone.",
