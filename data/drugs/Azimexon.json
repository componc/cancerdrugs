Immunostimulant which shows therapeutic effects in tumor models and experimental infections in vitro, enhancing T lymphocyte transformation and phagocytosis. The mode of action of azimexon is unknown. It has been suggested that azimexon may alkylate DNA. In cancer patients it increases leukocytosis, blood active T rosettes, T4/T8 ratio, and is used as an adjuvant to chemotherapy in the treatment of melanoma and myeloma.",
