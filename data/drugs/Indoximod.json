    "definition": "A methylated tryptophan with immune checkpoint inhibitory activity. Indoximod inhibits the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which degrades the essential amino acid tryptophan, and may increase or maintain tryptophan levels important to T cell function. Tryptophan depletion is associated with immunosuppression involving T cell arrest and anergy.",
