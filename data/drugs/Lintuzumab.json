    "definition": "A humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody directed against CD33, a cell surface antigen found on myeloid leukemia blasts and early hematopoietic progenitor cells. Lintuzumab stimulates antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against tumor cells expressing CD33, resulting in a decrease in tumor burden. The humanized version of this monoclonal antibody exhibits less immunogenicity and improved binding affinity compared to its murine counterpart.",
