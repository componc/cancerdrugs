    "definition": "A fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1 or CD54), with potential antineoplastic activity. Bersanlimab selectively binds to the adhesion protein ICAM-1, which may result in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), hyper-cross-linking-induced apoptosis, and a decrease in cellular proliferation of ICAM-1-expressing tumor cells. ICAM-1, normally expressed on leukocytes and endothelial cells, may be overexpressed in a variety of cancers.",
