    "definition": "A humanized monoclonal antibody (MoAb) against the external domain of the Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), overexpressed in the malignant prostate and its metastases. Although PSMA is not a biomarker of disease progression, over-expression indicates an aggressive phenotype of the prostate cancer. Rosopatamab was generated by replacing murine Ig sequences with human ones, thereby MoAb huJ591can be administered to patients on multiple occasions over long time periods without inducing an immune response. Radiolabelled MoAb huJ591 may be used in immunotherapy of prostate cancer.",
