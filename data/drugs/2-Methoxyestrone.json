    "definition": "A metabolite formed during the methylation of 2-hydroxyestrone (2-OHE1) by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), with potential anticarcinogenic and minimal estrogen activities. The mechanism of action for the antitumor activity of 2-methoxyestrone (2-OMeE1) is not known. A high 2-methoxyestrone (2-OMeE1)/2-OHE1 ratio indicates higher methylation efficiency and correlates with a lower cancer risk.",
