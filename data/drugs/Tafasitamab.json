This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate [see Clinical Studies (14) ] .

    "definition": "An Fc engineered, humanized anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody directed against the B-cell-specific membrane protein CD19 with potential immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities.Tafasitamab targets and binds to CD19, thereby depleting and eliminating CD19-expressing B-cells. The modified Fc region of XmAb5574 increases binding affinity to Fc-gamma receptors of effector cells and thereby enhances antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP). CD19 is widely expressed during B-cell development, from pro-B-cell to early plasma cell stages.",
