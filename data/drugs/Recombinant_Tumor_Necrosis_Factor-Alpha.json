    "definition": "A recombinant therapeutic agent which is chemically identical to or similar to the endogenous cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha with antineoplastic properties.  Tumor necrosis factor-alpha binds to and activates \"death receptors\" on the cell surface, resulting in apoptosis and cell death by the p53-independent extrinsic pathway. This agent also disrupts tumor vascularization.",
