    "definition": "An orally available inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, rineterkib binds to and inhibits ERK, thereby preventing the activation of ERK-mediated signal transduction pathways. This results in the inhibition of ERK-dependent tumor cell proliferation and survival. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK pathway is upregulated in numerous tumor cell types and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation, differentiation and survival.",
