    "definition": "The phosphate salt form of infigratinib, an orally bioavailable pan-inhibitor of human fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) with potential antiangiogenic and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, infigratinib selectively binds to and inhibits the activities of FGFRs, which may result in the inhibition of angiogenesis and cell proliferation, and the induction of cell death in tumors with activating FGFR amplifications, mutations, or fusions. FGFRs are a family of receptor tyrosine kinases that are involved in tumor cell differentiation and proliferation, tumor angiogenesis, and tumor cell survival. Activating FGFR amplifications, mutations, or fusions occur in various cancer cell types.",
