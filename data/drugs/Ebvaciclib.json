    "definition": "An orally bioavailable, cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, ebvaciclib selectively targets, binds to and inhibits the activity of CDKs. Inhibition of these kinases leads to cell cycle arrest, an induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. CDKs are ATP-dependent serine/threonine kinases that are important regulators of cell cycle progression and proliferation and are frequently overexpressed in tumor cells.",
