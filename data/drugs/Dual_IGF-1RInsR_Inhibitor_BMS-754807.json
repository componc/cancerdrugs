    "definition": "An oral small molecule inhibitor of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) and insulin receptor (InsR) tyrosine kinases with potential antineoplastic activity. Dual IGF-IR/InsR inhibitor BMS-754807 binds reversibly to and inhibits the activities of IGF-1R and InsR, which may result in the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. IGF-1R and InsR tyrosine kinases, overexpressed in a variety of human cancers, play significant roles in mitogenesis, angiogenesis, and tumor cell survival.",
