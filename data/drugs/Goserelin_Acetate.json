Treatment with ZOLADEX and flutamide should start 8 weeks prior to initiating radiation therapy and continue during radiation therapy [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. 1.2 Prostatic Carcinoma ZOLADEX is indicated in the palliative treatment of advanced carcinoma of the prostate [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )]. 1.3 Endometriosis ZOLADEX is indicated for the management of endometriosis, including pain relief and reduction of endometriotic lesions for the duration of therapy. Experience with ZOLADEX for the management of endometriosis has been limited to women 18 years of age and older treated for 6 months [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )]. 1.4 Endometrial Thinning ZOLADEX is indicated for use as an endometrial-thinning agent prior to endometrial ablation for dysfunctional uterine bleeding [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.4 )]. 1.5 Advanced Breast Cancer ZOLADEX is indicated for use in the palliative treatment of advanced breast cancer in pre- and perimenopausal women. The estrogen and progesterone receptor values may help to predict whether ZOLADEX therapy is likely to be beneficial [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ), and Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )]. The automatic safety feature of the syringe aids in the prevention of needlestick injury.",

In controlled studies of patients with advanced prostatic cancer comparing ZOLADEX 3.6 mg to orchiectomy, the long-term endocrine responses and objective responses were similar between the two treatment arms. Additionally, duration of survival was similar between the two treatment arms in a major comparative trial. In controlled studies of patients with advanced prostatic cancer, ZOLADEX 10.8 mg implant produced pharmacodynamically similar effect in terms of suppression of serum testosterone to that achieved with ZOLADEX 3.6 mg implant. Clinical outcome similar to that produced with the use of the ZOLADEX 3.6 mg implant administered every 28 days is predicted with the ZOLADEX 10.8 mg implant administered every 12 weeks.
