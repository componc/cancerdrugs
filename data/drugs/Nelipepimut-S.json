    "definition": "A cancer vaccine comprised of a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) A2/A3 restricted HER2/neu (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2; ErbB2) nonapeptide derived from the extracellular domain of the HER2 protein, with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon intradermal injection, nelipepimut-S may induce a specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against HER2/neu-expressing tumor cells. HER2/neu, a tumor-associated antigen and a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family of tyrosine kinases, is overexpressed in various tumor cell types and plays a key role in tumorigenesis.",
