    "definition": "A synthetic, small molecule, toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 agonist, with potential immunostimulatory and antineoplastic activities. Upon intravenous administration, guretolimod activates TLR7, resulting in type I interferon secretion and activation of  cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated anti-tumor immune responses. TLR7 is a member of the TLR family, which plays a fundamental role in pathogen recognition and activation of innate immunity.",
