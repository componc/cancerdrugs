    "definition": "A fully human monoclonal antibody directed against angiopoietin 2 (ANG2) with potential antiangiogenic and antineoplastic activities. Nesvacumab binds to ANG2 and interferes with the interaction between Ang2 and its receptor TEK tyrosine kinase (Tie2), which may inhibit tumor cell angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation. ANG2 is upregulated in a variety of cancer cell types and plays a crucial role in angiogenesis.",
