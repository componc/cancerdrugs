    "definition": "A chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against CD80, the natural ligand for the T-cell antigen CD28 which mediates T-cell and B-cell adhesion. Galiximab binds to CD80 expressed on the cell surfaces of follicular lymphomas, resulting in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). CD80 is expressed on activated B-cells and gamma-interferon-stimulated monocytes and is often expressed at low levels on the surfaces of follicular lymphoma cells and other lymphoid malignancies.",
