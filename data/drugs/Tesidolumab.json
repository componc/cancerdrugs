    "definition": "A human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody directed against the complement pathway protein C5, with complement pathway inhibitory activity and potential immunomodulating activity. Upon administration, tesidolumab targets and binds to C5, thereby preventing both C5 convertase-mediated cleavage of C5 and the formation of C5a and C5b. This inhibits C5-mediated signal transduction, the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) and the activation of the terminal complement pathway, and results in the prevention and/or inhibition of both complement-mediated inflammation and cell destruction. C5 plays a key role in the activation of the complement cascade.",
