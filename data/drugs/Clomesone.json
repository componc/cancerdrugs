    "definition": "The 2-chloroethyl ester of (methylsulfonyl) methanesulfonic acid with potential antineoplastic effects.  Acting as a chloroethylating agent, clomesone induces the formation of DNA interstrand crosslinks in some cell lines, and exhibits antitumor activity in some animal models.  Alkylating agents exert cytotoxic and, in some cases, chemotherapeutic effects by transferring alkyl groups to DNA, thereby damaging DNA and interfering with DNA synthesis and cell division.",
