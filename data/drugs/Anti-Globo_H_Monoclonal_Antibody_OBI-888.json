    "definition": "A monoclonal antibody targeting the hexasaccharide glycosphingolipid antigen Globo H with potential immunostimulating, anti-angiogenic and antineoplastic activities. Upon infusion, anti-Globo H monoclonal antibody OBI-888 may induce tumor cell destruction via the activation of antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and may reduce immunosuppression. Globo H is a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) expressed on the surface of various types of cancer cells.",
