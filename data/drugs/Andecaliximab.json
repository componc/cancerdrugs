    "definition": "A humanized monoclonal antibody against matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, andecaliximab binds to MMP-9 and inhibits its enzymatic activity. This results in an inhibition of extracellular matrix protein degradation and, potentially, the inhibition of angiogenesis, tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. MMP-9, a protein belonging to the MMP family, plays a key role in the degradation of collagens and proteoglycans; increased activity of MMP-9 has been associated with increased invasion and metastasis of cancer.",
