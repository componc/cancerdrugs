    "definition": "An orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, iNOS Dimerization Inhibitor FK-330 inhibits iNOS dimerization, which results in decreased nitric oxide (NO) production. iNOS expression is upregulated in certain cancers and may invoke a chronic inflammatory state in tumor cells that promotes metastatic growth.",
