    "definition": "A monoclonal antibody directed against human transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), with potential antineoplastic activity. Anti-TGF-beta monoclonal antibody NIS793 specifically targets and binds to TGF-beta, thereby preventing the activation of TGF-beta-mediated signaling pathways. TGF-beta, a pro-inflammatory mediator that is mutated and/or overexpressed in a number of cancer cell types, is involved in cancer cell proliferation and migration, and tumor progression.",
