    "definition": "A recombinant fusion protein comprised of a human monoclonal antibody directed against the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM or KS) linked to an active interleukin-2 (IL2) molecule with potential antineoplastic activity. Tucotuzumab Celmoleukin recognizes and binds to EpCAM, a cell surface epithelial protein that is expressed on a wide variety of cancer cells, thereby concentrating IL2 in EpCAM-expressing tumor tissue. Subsequently, the localized IL2 moiety of the fusion protein may stimulate a cytotoxic T-cell antitumor immune response.",
