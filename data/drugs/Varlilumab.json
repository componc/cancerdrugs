    "definition": "A human agonistic monoclonal antibody (MoAb) specific for CD27, with potential immunostimulating and antineoplastic activity. Upon administration of varlilumab, this MoAb binds to CD27 and may potentiate the immune response by increasing the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against CD27-expressing tumor cells. This may lead to growth inhibition of CD27-expressing tumor cells. In addition, this agent may increase the proliferation and activation of antigen-specific T lymphocytes upon co-administration of TAA-containing vaccines, such as dendritic cell vaccines. CD27, a co-stimulatory molecule and member of the tumor necrosis factor family overexpressed in certain tumor cell types, is constitutively expressed on mature T-lymphocytes, memory B cells and natural killer cells and plays an important role in NK cell mediated cytolytic activity and T and B lymphocyte proliferation and activation.",
