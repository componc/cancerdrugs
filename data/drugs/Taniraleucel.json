    "definition": "A population of cryopreserved, off-the-shelf (OTS) allogeneic natural killer (NK) cells derived from human placental hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and expressing the CD56 surface antigen and exhibiting a lack of CD3, with potential immunomodulating, antineoplastic and antiviral activities. Upon infusion of taniraleucel, these cells are able to recognize tumor cells as well as virally-infected cells, secrete perforins, granzymes and cytokines, and induce apoptosis in tumor and virally-infected cells.",
