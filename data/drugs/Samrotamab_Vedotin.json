    "definition": "An antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a humanized monoclonal antibody against leucine-rich repeat containing 15 (LRRC15) linked, via the protease-cleavable valine-citrulline linker, to the microtubule-disrupting cytotoxic agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration of samrotamab vedotin, the samrotamab moiety targets and binds to LRRC15 expressed on cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and tumor cells. Upon binding and internalization, MMAE is released after proteolytic cleavage. MMAE targets and binds to tubulin, and inhibits microtubule polymerization. This results in G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in LRRC15-expressing CAFs and tumor cells. LRRC15, a type I membrane protein and a member of the LRR superfamily, is highly expressed on CAFs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) within some tumor stroma and on tumor cells in certain tumors.",
