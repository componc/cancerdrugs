    "definition": "An orally-active agent with potential antineoplastic activity.  Carboxyamidotriazole binds to and inhibits non-voltage-operated Ca2+ channels, blocking both Ca2+ influx into cells and Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and resulting in the disruption of calcium channel-mediated signal transduction and inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling, endothelial proliferation, and angiogenesis.  This agent may also inhibit tumor cell growth, invasion and metastasis.",
