( 1.1 ) In combination with everolimus, for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following one prior anti-angiogenic therapy. ( 1.2 ) For the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). ( 1.3 ) In combination with pembrolizumab, for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR), who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trial. ( 1.4 ) 1.1 Differentiated Thyroid Cancer LENVIMA is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). 1.2 Renal Cell Carcinoma LENVIMA is indicated in combination with everolimus for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following one prior anti-angiogenic therapy. 1.3 Hepatocellular Carcinoma LENVIMA is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 1.4 Endometrial Carcinoma LENVIMA, in combination with pembrolizumab, is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR), who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response [see Clinical Studies ( 14.4 )] .
