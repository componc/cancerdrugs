    "definition": "A humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the human chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2), with potential antiangiogenic, immunomodulating, antimetastatic, and antineoplastic activities. Plozalizumab binds to CCR2 and prevents binding of the endothelium-derived CLL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 or MCP1) to its receptor CCR2, which may result in inhibition of CCR2 activation and so inhibition of angiogenesis, tumor cell migration, and tumor cell proliferation. In addition, this agent may reduce levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). The G-protein coupled receptor CCR2 is expressed on the surface of monocytes and macrophages, stimulates the migration and infiltration of these cell types, and plays an important role in inflammation, angiogenesis, and tumor cell migration and proliferation.",
