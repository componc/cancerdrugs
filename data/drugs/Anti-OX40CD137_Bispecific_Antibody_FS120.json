    "definition": "An immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) dual-agonist, tetravalent, bispecific monoclonal antibody targeting the two human tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) co-stimulatory receptors OX40 (CD134; tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 4; TNFRSF4) and CD137 (4-1BB; tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 9; TNFRSF9), with potential immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, anti-OX40/CD137 bispecific antibody FS120 simultaneously targets, binds to, and activates both OX40 and CD137. This may lead to T-cell co-stimulation, induce the proliferation of memory and effector T-lymphocytes and enhance immune-mediated anti-tumor responses. OX40 and CD137, cell surface glycoproteins and members of the TNFRSF, are expressed on T-lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells and play an essential role in T-cell activation, differentiation, proliferation, survival and cytolytic activity.",
