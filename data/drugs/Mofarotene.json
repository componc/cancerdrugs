    "definition": "An arotinoic acid derivative with a morpholine structure in the polar end group with differentiation inducing and antineoplastic activity. Like other retinoic acid agents, mofarotene binds to and activates retinoic acid receptors (RARs), thereby altering the expression of certain genes leading to cell differentiation and decreased cell proliferation in susceptible cells. In addition, this agent is able to inhibit melanoma cell motility.",
