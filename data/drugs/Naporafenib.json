    "definition": "An orally available inhibitor of all members of the serine/threonine protein kinase Raf family, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, naporafenib binds to Raf proteins and inhibits Raf-mediated signal transduction pathways. This inhibits proliferation of Raf-overexpressing tumor cells. Raf protein kinases are critical enzymes in the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway and are upregulated in a variety of cancer cell types. They play key roles in tumor cell proliferation and survival.",
