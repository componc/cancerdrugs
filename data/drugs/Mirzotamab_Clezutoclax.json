Upon intravenous administration of mirzotamab clezutoclax, the monoclonal antibody moiety of ABBV-155 targets and binds to the TAA expressed on tumor cells. Upon binding and internalization, the cytotoxic agent is released and kills the TAA-expressing cancer cells, through an as of yet unknown mechanism of action.",
