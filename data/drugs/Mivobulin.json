    "definition": "A synthetic, colchicine analogue with potential antineoplastic activity. Mivobulin targets and binds to colchicine-binding site on tubulin, thereby inhibiting microtubule polymerization, the assembly of the mitotic spindle and mitosis. This eventually results in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and a reduction in cellular proliferation.",
