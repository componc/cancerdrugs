    "definition": "An orally available, ATP-competitive inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, xiliertinib binds to and inhibits the activity of EGFR. This prevents EGFR-mediated signaling, and may lead to both induction of cell death and inhibition of tumor growth in EGFR-overexpressing cells. EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase mutated in many tumor cell types, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization.",
