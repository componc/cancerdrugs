    "definition": "An agonistic fully human anti-OX40 (tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 4; TNFRSF4; CD134; OX40L receptor) with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, cudarolimab selectively binds to and activates OX40. Receptor activation induces proliferation of memory and effector T-lymphocytes and results in a T-cell-mediated immune response against tumor cells, which leads to tumor cell lysis. OX40, a cell surface glycoprotein and member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF), is expressed on T-lymphocytes and provides a co-stimulatory signal that promotes both the proliferation and survival of activated T-cells.",
