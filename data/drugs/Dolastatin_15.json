    "definition": "A depsipeptide originally isolated from the marine mollusk Dolabella auricularia with potential antineoplastic activity.  Less potent than the structurally-related compound dolastatin 10, dolastatin 15 binds weakly to tubulin and blocks microtubule assembly, thereby inhibiting mitosis.  Dolastatin 15 also induces tumor cell apoptosis through a mechanism involving bcl-2, an oncoprotein that is overexpressed in some cancers.",
