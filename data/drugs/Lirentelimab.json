    "definition": "A humanized, nonfucosylated immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody directed against the inhibitory receptor sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 8 (Siglec-8) expressed on human mast cells and eosinophils, with potential anti-inflammatory activity. Upon administration, lirentelimab targets and binds to Siglec-8 expressed on the surface of mast cells and eosinophils. This may inhibit mast cell activation and deplete eosinophils through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and apoptosis. This may reduce abnormal proliferation of mast cells and eosinophils, which plays a key role in allergic and inflammatory responses.",
