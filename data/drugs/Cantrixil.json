    "definition": "A cyclodextrin-encapsulated, third generation super-benzopyran (SBP) compound with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon intraperitoneal (IP) administration, cantrixil enhances the activation and expression of c-Jun, downregulates phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) and induces activation of caspase-3, -7 and -9, thereby inducing tumor cell apoptosis. c-Jun, an activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor component, is involved in a wide range of cellular processes including cell cycle progression, differentiation, cell transformation and apoptosis.",
