    "definition": "The calcium salt form of glucaric acid, a natural substance found in many fruits and vegetables, with potential anti-cancer property. One of the key processes in which the human body eliminates toxic chemicals as well as hormones (such as estrogen) is by attaching glucuronic acid to them in the liver and then excreting the complex in the bile. When beta-glucuronidase breaks the bond, it prolongs the stay of the hormone or toxic chemical in the body. Elevated beta-glucuronidase activity has been implicated to be associated with an increased risk for hormone-dependent cancers like breast, prostate, and colon cancers. Therefore, supplementing calcium glucarate may suppress the developments of hormone-dependent cancers.",
