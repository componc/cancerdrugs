    "definition": "A humanized immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody directed against AXL receptor tyrosine kinase (AXL; UFO), with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, tilvestamab targets, binds to and inhibits the activity of AXL, which is expressed on the surfaces of a variety of cancer cell types. This prevents AXL-mediated signaling, and may inhibit tumor cell proliferation, migration and invasion. AXL, a member of the TAM (TYRO3, AXL and MER) family of receptor tyrosine kinases, is overexpressed by many tumor cell types, and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation, survival, invasion and metastasis; its expression is associated with drug resistance, tumor immune evasion and poor prognosis.",
