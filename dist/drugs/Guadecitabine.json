    "definition": "A dinucleotide antimetabolite composed of a decitabine linked via phosphodiester bond to a deoxyguanosine, with potential antineoplastic activity. Following metabolic activation via cleavage of the phosphodiester bond and incorporation of the decitabine moiety into DNA, guadecitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase, thereby causing non-specific, genome-wide hypomethylation, and induction of cell cycle arrest at S-phase. This agent is resistant to cytidine deaminase, which may result in gradual release of decitabine both extra- and intra-cellularly, leading to prolonged exposure to decitabine.",
