    "definition": "An iodine 131 labeled radioimmunoconjugate of monoclonal antibody (MOAB) TNT-1/B with radioimaging and antineoplastic properties. MOAB TNT-1/B was developed for radioimmunotherapy of solid tumors, designated as Tumor Necrosis Treatment (TNT). TNT exploits the presence of degenerating and necrotic cells within tumors by utilizing MOAbs directed against universal, intracellular nucleosomal determinants consisting of histone H1 and DNA. This MOAB was conjugated with biotin (B) molecules, which increase pharmacokinetic performance of the monoclonal antibody. Upon administration, iodine I 131 derlotuximab biotin delivers I 131 to tumor cells and results in the targeted imaging and/or destruction of cells with exposed necrotic antigens.",
