    "definition": "An agent that targets p-cadherin (CDH3), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, PF-06671008 binds to and inhibits the activity of p-cadherin; this may inhibit both invasion and proliferation of p-cadherin expressing tumor cells. P-cadherin, a cell-surface protein and member of the cadherin family, is overexpressed in a variety of tumors and plays a role in cell adhesion, motility, invasion, and proliferation.",
