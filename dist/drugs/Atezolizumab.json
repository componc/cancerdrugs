      "indication": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE TECENTRIQ is a programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blocking antibody indicated: Urothelial Carcinoma for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who: are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy and whose tumors express PD-L1 (PD-L1 stained tumor-infiltrating immune cells [IC] covering \u2265 5% of the tumor area), as determined by an FDA-approved test, or are not eligible for any platinum-containing chemotherapy regardless of PD-L1 status This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s). ( 1.1 ) Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) as adjuvant treatment following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for adult patients with Stage II to IIIA NSCLC whose tumors have PD-L1 expression on \u2265 1% of tumor cells, as determined by an FDA-approved test. ( 1.2 , 14.2 ) for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression (PD-L1 stained \u2265 50% of tumor cells [TC \u2265 50%] or PD-L1 stained tumor-infiltrating immune cells [IC] covering \u2265 10% of the tumor area [IC \u2265 10%] ), as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. ( 1.2 ) in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. ( 1.2 ) in combination with paclitaxel protein-bound and carboplatin for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations ( 1.2 ) for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for NSCLC harboring these aberrations prior to receiving TECENTRIQ.

    "definition": "A humanized, Fc optimized, monoclonal antibody directed against the protein ligand PD-L1 (programmed cell death-1 ligand 1), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Atezolizumab binds to PD-L1, blocking its binding to and activation of its receptor programmed death 1 (PD-1) expressed on activated T-cells, which may enhance the T-cell-mediated immune response to neoplasms and reverse T-cell inactivation. In addition, by binding to PD-L1, MPDL3280A also prevents binding of this ligand to B7.1 expressed on activated T cells, which further enhances the T-cell-mediated immune response. PD-L1 is overexpressed on many human cancer cell types and on various tumor-infiltrating immune cells. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in increased immune evasion. PD-1, a transmembrane protein, is a negative regulator of the immune system that limits the expansion and survival of CD8+ T cells. The Fc region of MPDL3280A is modified in such a way that it does not induce either antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).",
