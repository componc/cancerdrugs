Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) at high risk of relapse or progression as post-autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) consolidation ( 1.2 ). Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) after failure of auto-HSCT or after failure of at least two prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimens in patients who are not auto-HSCT candidates ( 1.3 ). Previously untreated systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL) or other CD30-expressing peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL), including angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and PTCL not otherwise specified, in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone ( 1.4 ). Systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL) after failure of at least one prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimen ( 1.5 ). Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL) or CD30-expressing mycosis fungoides (MF) who have received prior systemic therapy ( 1.6 ). 1.1 Previously untreated Stage III or IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), in combination with chemotherapy ADCETRIS is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated Stage III or IV cHL, in combination with doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine. 1.2 Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) consolidation ADCETRIS is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with cHL at high risk of relapse or progression as post-autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) consolidation. 1.3 Relapsed classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) ADCETRIS is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with cHL after failure of auto-HSCT or after failure of at least two prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimens in patients who are not auto-HSCT candidates. 1.4 Previously untreated systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL) or other CD30-expressing peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL), in combination with chemotherapy ADCETRIS is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated sALCL or other CD30-expressing PTCL, including angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and PTCL not otherwise specified, in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone. 1.5 Relapsed systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL) ADCETRIS is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with sALCL after failure of at least one prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimen . 1.6 Relapsed primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL) or CD30-expressing mycosis fungoides (MF) ADCETRIS is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with pcALCL or CD30-expressing MF who have received prior systemic therapy .",

    "definition": "An antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) directed against the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor CD30 with potential antineoplastic activity. Brentuximab vedotin is generated by conjugating the chimeric anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody SGN-30 to the cytotoxic agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a valine-citrulline peptide linker. Upon administration and internalization by CD30-positive tumor cells, brentuximab vedotin undergoes enzymatic cleavage, releasing MMAE into the cytosol; MMAE binds to tubulin and inhibits tubulin polymerization, which may result in G2/M phase arrest and tumor cell apoptosis. Transiently activated during lymphocyte activation, CD30 (tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 8;TNFRSF8) may be constitutively expressed in hematologic malignancies including Hodgkin lymphoma and some T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. The linkage system in brentuximab vedotin is highly stable in plasma, resulting in cytotoxic specificity for CD30-positive cells.",
