    "definition": "A neurotoxin with potential anticancer property. Chlorotoxin (CTX) is a 36-amino acid peptide found in the venom of the deathstalker scorpion, and a chloride channel blocker. This toxin binds preferentially to glioma cells via the transmembrane endopeptidase matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and thereby prevents the spread of tumor cells. MMP-2 is specifically up-regulated in gliomas and related cancers, but is not normally expressed in brain.",
