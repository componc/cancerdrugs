    "definition": "A preparation of autologous T-lymphocytes that have been genetically engineered to express a single-domain antibody that recognizes human mesothelin, fused to the N-terminus of the CD3-epsilon T-cell receptor (TCR) subunit which, upon expression is incorporated into the endogenous TCR complex, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, gavocabtagene autoleucel specifically target and bind to mesothelin-expressing tumor cells. This leads to T-cell activation and T-cell mediated lysis of mesothelin-expressing tumor cells. Mesothelin, a cell surface glycoprotein involved in cell adhesion, is overexpressed in a variety of cancer cell types. Compared to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells, TRuCs may be associated with less pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and fewer adverse effects without compromising therapeutic efficacy.",
