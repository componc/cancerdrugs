    "definition": "A carbohydrate-based vaccine comprised of the Globo H hexasaccharide 1 (Globo H) antigen conjugated to DT-CRM197, a non-toxic, mutated form of diphtheria toxin (DT), with potential immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration of Globo H-DT vaccine OBI-833, the carbohydrate antigen Globo H may stimulate a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against Globo H-expressing tumor cells, thereby decreasing tumor cell proliferation. The hexasaccharide Globo H is a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) commonly found on a variety of tumor cells. DT-CRM197, also called diphtheria toxin cross-reacting material 197, is used to increase the immunogenicity of the Globo H carbohydrate antigen.",
