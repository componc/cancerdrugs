    "definition": "A humanized monoclonal antibody fused to two peptides that bind to angiopoietin 2 (Ang2; ANGPT2), with potential anti-angiogenic and antineoplastic activities. Upon intravenous administration, Ang2-targeting PF-04856884 CovX body specifically binds to Ang2 and prevents the binding of Ang2 to its receptor Tie2 expressed on endothelial cells. This inhibits Tie2-mediated signaling, prevents angiogenesis and inhibits tumor cell proliferation.  Ang2, a proangiogenic cytokine and ligand for the Tie2 receptor, plays a key role in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation; its expression is upregulated by tumor endothelial cells.",
