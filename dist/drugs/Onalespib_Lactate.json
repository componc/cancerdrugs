    "definition": "The lactate form of onalespib, a synthetic, orally bioavailable, small-molecule inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) with potential antineoplastic activity. Onalespib selectively binds to Hsp90, thereby inhibiting its chaperone function and promoting the degradation of oncogenic signaling proteins involved in tumor cell proliferation and survival. Hsp90, a chaperone protein upregulated in a variety of tumor cells, regulates the folding, stability and degradation of many oncogenic signaling proteins.",
