    "definition": "A recombinant, humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the cancer stem cell (CSC) antigen CD44, with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, RO5429083 binds to the constant region of the extracellular domain of CD44, thereby preventing the activation of various CD44-mediated signal transduction pathways. This may lead to a reduction in the proliferation of CD44-expressing tumor stem cells. CD44, a transmembrane glycoprotein and hyaluronic acid receptor, is expressed in healthy tissue and overexpressed in numerous cancer cell types; it plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation, migration and survival.",
