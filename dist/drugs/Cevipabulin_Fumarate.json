    "definition": "The fumarate salt of cevipabulin, a synthetic, water soluble tubulin-binding agent with potential antineoplastic activity. Cevipabulin appears to bind at the vinca-binding site on tubulin, but seems to act more similar to taxane-site binding agents in that it enhances tubulin polymerization and does not induce tubulin depolymerization. The disruption in microtubule dynamics may eventually inhibit cell division and reduce cellular growth., a small, water soluble, synthetic tubulin-binding agent with potential antineoplastic activity.
