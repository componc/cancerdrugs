( 1.1 ). Relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) after at least two prior systemic therapies. ( 1.2 ). This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. 1.1 Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL) COPIKTRA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL after at least two prior therapies. 1.2 Follicular Lymphoma (FL) COPIKTRA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory FL after at least two prior systemic therapies. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate (ORR) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )]; continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.",

    "definition": "An orally bioavailable, highly selective and potent small molecule inhibitor of the delta and gamma isoforms of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, duvelisib prevents the activation of the PI3K delta/gamma-mediated signaling pathways which may lead to a reduction in cellular proliferation in PI3K delta/gamma-expressing tumor cells. Unlike other isoforms of PI3K, the delta and gamma isoforms are overexpressed primarily in hematologic malignancies and inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. By selectively targeting these PI3K isoforms, PI3K signaling in normal, non-neoplastic cells is minimally or not affected which would result in a more favorable side effect profile.",
