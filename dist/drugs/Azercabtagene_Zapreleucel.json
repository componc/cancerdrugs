    "definition": "A preparation of allogeneic, off-the-shelf, T-lymphocytes that have been genetically modified using a proprietary synthetic nuclease-based system to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting the tumor-associated antigen (TAA) CD19 (cluster of differentiation 19) with potential immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, azercabtagene zapreleucel specifically recognize and kill CD19-expressing tumor cells. CD19 antigen is a B-cell specific cell surface antigen, which is expressed in all B-cell lineage malignancies and normal B-cells.",
