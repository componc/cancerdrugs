    "definition": "A lipophilic, diaminopyrimidine folate antagonist with potential antineoplastic activity. Etoprine inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, resulting in decreased cellular folate metabolism. This may eventually result in a reduction of cellular growth and the induction of apoptosis. In addition, this agent inhibits histamine-N-methyltransferase, resulting in decreased histamine catabolism. Lipid-soluble etoprine is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier.",
