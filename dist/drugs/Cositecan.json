    "definition": "A synthetic silicon-containing agent related to camptothecin with antineoplastic properties.  Cositecan stabilizes the cleavable complex between topoisomerase I and DNA, resulting in DNA breaks and consequently triggering apoptosis.  Because it is lipophilic, cositecan exhibits enhanced tissue penetration and bio-availability compared to water-soluble camptothecins.",
