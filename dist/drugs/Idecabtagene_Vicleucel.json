    "definition": "A preparation of autologous peripheral blood T-lymphocytes (PBTLs) that have been genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) specific for the B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), with potential immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, idecabtagene vicleucel specifically recognizes and kills BCMA-expressing tumor cells. BCMA, a tumor-specific antigen and a receptor for both a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) and B-cell activating factor (BAFF), is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) and plays a key role in plasma survival; it is found on the surfaces of plasma cells and overexpressed on malignant plasma cells.",
