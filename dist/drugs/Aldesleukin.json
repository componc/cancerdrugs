Proleukin is indicated for the treatment of adults with metastatic melanoma. Careful patient selection is mandatory prior to the administration of Proleukin. See \u201c CONTRAINDICATIONS \u201d, \u201c WARNINGS \u201d and \u201c PRECAUTIONS \u201d sections regarding patient screening, including recommended cardiac and pulmonary function tests and laboratory tests. Evaluation of clinical studies to date reveals that patients with more favorable ECOG performance status (ECOG PS 0) at treatment initiation respond better to Proleukin, with a higher response rate and lower toxicity (See \u201c CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY \u201d section, \u201c CLINICAL STUDIES \u201d section and \u201c ADVERSE REACTIONS \u201d section). Therefore, selection of patients for treatment should include assessment of performance status. Experience in patients with ECOG PS >1 is extremely limited.",

    "definition": "A recombinant analog of the endogenous cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) with immunoregulatory and antineoplastic activities. Aldesleukin binds to and activates the IL-2 receptor, followed by heterodimerization of the cytoplasmic domains of the IL-2R beta and gamma(c) chains; activation of the tyrosine kinase Jak3; and phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the IL-2R beta chain, resulting in an activated receptor complex. Various cytoplasmic signaling molecules are recruited to the activated receptor complex and become substrates for regulatory enzymes that are associated with the receptor complex. This agent enhances lymphocyte mitogenesis; stimulates long-term growth of human IL-2 dependent cell lines; enhances lymphocyte cytotoxicity; induces lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell and natural killer (NK) cell activities; and induces expression of interferon-gamma. Aldesleukin may induce T cell-mediated tumor regression in some tumor types.",
