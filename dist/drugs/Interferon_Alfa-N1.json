    "definition": "A highly purified alpha interferon produced by a human lymphoid cell line.  Interferon alpha-n1 consists of multiple alpha interferon subtypes, at least two of which are glycosylated.  In contrast, recombinant alpha interferons are individual non-glycosylated proteins produced from individual alpha interferon genes.  Alpha interferons bind to specific cell-surface receptors, resulting in the transcription and translation of genes whose proteins have antiviral, antiproliferative, anticancer, and immune-modulating effects.",
