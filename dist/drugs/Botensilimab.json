    "definition": "An Fc-engineered recombinant human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody directed against the human T-cell receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), with immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody  botensilimab binds to CTLA-4 expressed on T-cells and inhibits the CTLA-4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation. This leads to a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against cancer cells. CTLA-4, an inhibitory receptor and member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, plays a key role in the downregulation of the immune system. The engineered Fc domain increases the stability and half-life of the antibody.",
