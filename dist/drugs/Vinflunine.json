    "definition": "A bi-fluorinated derivative of the semi-synthetic vinca alkaloid vinorelbine with antitubulin, antineoplastic, and antiangiogenic activities. Vinflunine inhibits tubulin assembly without any stablization of assembled microtubules at concentrations comparable to those of other vinca alkaloids such as vincristine, vinblastine and vinorelbine; this effect on microtubule dynamics results in cell cycle arrest in mitosis and apoptosis. Compared to other vinca alkaloids, this agent binds weakly to the vinca-binding site, indicating that vinflunine may exhibit reduced neurotoxicity.",
