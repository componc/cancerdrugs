    "definition": "An antibody against the inhibitory T-cell receptor T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (TIM-3; TIM3; hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 2; HAVCR2), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Following administration, anti-TIM-3 antibody BMS-986258 binds to TIM-3 that is expressed on certain T-cells, including tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). This abrogates T-cell inhibition, activates antigen-specific T-lymphocytes and enhances cytotoxic T-cell-mediated tumor cell lysis, which together result in decreased tumor growth. TIM-3, a transmembrane protein and immune checkpoint receptor, is associated with tumor-mediated immune suppression.",
