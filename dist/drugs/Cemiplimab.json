( 1.1 ) Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) for the treatment of patients with locally advanced BCC (laBCC) previously treated with a hedgehog pathway inhibitor or for whom a hedgehog pathway inhibitor is not appropriate. ( 1.2 ) for the treatment of patients with metastatic BCC (mBCC) previously treated with a hedgehog pathway inhibitor or for whom a hedgehog pathway inhibitor is not appropriate. 1 ( 1.2 ) 1 The mBCC indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for mBCC may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit.

    "definition": "A human monoclonal antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory human cell surface receptor programmed cell death 1 (PD-1, PCD-1) protein, with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, cemiplimab binds to PD-1, inhibits its binding to the PD-1 ligand programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), and prevents the activation of its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore immune function through the activation of cytotoxic T-cells. PD-1, a transmembrane protein in the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed on activated T-cells, negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligand; it plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.",
