    "definition": "A synthetic decapeptide analog of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) with antineoplastic activity. Goserelin binds to and activates pituitary gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors. Prolonged administration of goserelin inhibits the secretion of pituitary gonadotropin, thereby decreasing levels of testosterone (in males) and estradiol (in females).  Administration of this agent in a depot formulation may result in the regression of sex hormone-sensitive tumors and a reduction in sex organ size and function.",
