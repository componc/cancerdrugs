    "definition": "An agonistic antibody for the inducible T-cell co-stimulator (ICOS; CD278), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, feladilimab targets and binds to ICOS expressed on tumor infiltrating CD4-positive T-cells. This stimulates ICOS-positive T-cell proliferation, enhances cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) survival and increases CTL-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. ICOS, a T-cell specific, CD28-superfamily costimulatory molecule and immune checkpoint protein, is normally expressed on certain activated T-cells and plays a key role in the proliferation and activation of T-cells.",
