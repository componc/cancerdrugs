    "definition": "An immunoconjugate consisting of a monoclonal antibody directed against a highly-expressed myeloma cell surface antigen covalently attached to the maytansinoid DM4, a derivative of the cytotoxic agent maytansine (DM1), with potential antineoplastic activity. Indatuximab ravtansine binds to an unspecified cell surface antigen highly expressed on myeloma cells; upon internalization the DM4 moiety is released, binding to tubulin and disrupting microtubule assembly/disassembly dynamics, which may result in the inhibition of cell division and cell growth of myeloma tumor cells.",
