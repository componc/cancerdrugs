    "definition": "An orally bioavailable inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAP2K; MAPK/ERK kinase; MEK) 1 and 2, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, trametinib specifically binds to and inhibits MEK 1 and 2, resulting in an inhibition of growth factor-mediated cell signaling and cellular proliferation in various cancers. MEK 1 and 2, dual specificity serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases often upregulated in various cancer cell types, play a key role in the activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway that regulates cell growth.",
