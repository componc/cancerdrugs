    "definition": "An orally bioavailable monoclonal antibody against CXC Chemokine Receptor 4 (CXCR4) with potential antineoplastic activity. Ulocuplumab binds to the chemokine receptor CXCR4, preventing the binding of stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1) to the CXCR4 receptor and subsequent receptor activation, which may result in decreased tumor cell proliferation and migration. CXCR4, a chemokine receptor belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor family, plays an important role in chemotaxis and angiogenesis and is upregulated in several tumor cell types.",
