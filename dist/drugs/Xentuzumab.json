    "definition": "A humanized IgG1 insulin-like growth factor (IGF) monoclonal antibody targeting the IGF ligands 1 (IGF-1) and 2 (IGF-2), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, xentuzumab binds to both IGF-1 and IGF-2 and inhibits the binding of these ligands to their receptor, IGF-1R. This blocks the insulin growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway, which is upregulated in a number of cancer cell types and plays a key role in cancer cell proliferation and chemoresistance. In addition, BI 836845 prevents the binding of IGF-2 to insulin receptor variant A (IR-A), preventing its activation.",
