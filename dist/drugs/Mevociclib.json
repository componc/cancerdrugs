    "definition": "A selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, SY-1365 binds to and inhibits CDK7, thereby inhibiting CDK7-mediated signal transduction pathways. This inhibits cell growth of CDK7-overexpressing tumor cells. CDK7, a serine/threonine kinase, plays a key role in cell proliferation; CDK7 is overexpressed in a variety of tumor cell types.",
