    "definition": "A monoclonal antibody directed against programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), with immune checkpoint inhibitory and potential antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody FAZ053 binds to PD-L1, blocking its binding to and activation of its receptor programmed death 1 (PD-1), which may enhance the T-cell-mediated anti-tumor immune response and reverse T-cell inactivation. PD-L1 is overexpressed by many human cancer cell types. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion. PD-1, a transmembrane protein expressed on activated T-cells, is a negative regulator of the immune system that limits the expansion and survival of CD8+ T-cells.",
