    "definition": "A formulated therapeutic analog of the endogenous alpha interferon containing multiple interferon species with antiviral and antitumor properties.  Interferons bind to specific cell-surface receptors, leading to the transcription and translation of genes with an interferon-specific response element, thereby inducing: antiviral effects (the most important being inhibition of viral protein synthesis); antiproliferative effects (including inhibition of cellular growth and alteration of cellular differentiation); anticancer effects (including interference with oncogene expression); and immune-modulating effects (including activation of natural killer cells, alteration of cell surface antigen expression, and augmentation of lymphocyte and macrophage cytotoxicity).",
