    "definition": "An inhibitor of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) type 2 (FGFR2), with potential antineoplastic and anti-angiogenic activities. Upon administration, alofanib targets, allosterically binds to the extracellular domain of FGFR2 and inhibits the activity of FGFR2, which may result in the inhibition of basic FGF (bFGF)/FGFR2-related signal transduction pathways. This inhibits FGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation and migration, and inhibits the proliferation of FGFR2-overexpressing tumor cells. FGFR2, a receptor tyrosine kinase upregulated in many tumor cell types, plays a key role in cellular proliferation, migration and survival.",
