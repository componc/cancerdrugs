    "definition": "A small molecule, competitive inhibitor of the ectoenzyme CD73 (cluster of differentiation 73; 5'-ecto-nucleotidase; 5'-NT; ecto-5'-nucleotidase), with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, quemliclustat targets and binds to CD73, leading to clustering of and internalization of CD73. This prevents CD73-mediated conversion of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine and decreases the amount of free adenosine in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This prevents adenosine-mediated lymphocyte suppression and increases the activity of CD8-positive effector cells and natural killer (NK) cells. This also activates macrophages and reduces the activity of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T-lymphocytes (Tregs). By abrogating the inhibitory effect on the immune system and enhancing the cytotoxic T-cell-mediated immune response against cancer cells, tumor cell growth decreases. In addition, clustering and internalization of CD73 decreases the migration of cancer cells and prevents metastasis. CD73, a plasma membrane protein belonging to the 5'-nucleotidase (NTase) family, upregulated on a number of cancer cell types, catalyzes the conversion of extracellular nucleotides, such as AMP, to membrane-permeable nucleosides, such as adenosine; it plays a key role in adenosine-mediated immunosuppression within the TME.",
