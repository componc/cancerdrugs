    "definition": "An orally bioavailable, small-molecule, multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor with potential antineoplastic activity. Glesatinib binds to and inhibits the phosphorylation of several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including the c-Met receptor (hepatocyte growth factor receptor); the Tek/Tie-2 receptor; vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) types 1, 2, and 3; and the macrophage-stimulating 1 receptor (MST1R or RON). Inhibition of these RTKs and their downstream signaling pathways may result in the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation in tumors overexpressing these RTKs.",
