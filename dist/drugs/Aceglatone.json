    "definition": "A derivative of D-glucaro-1, 4-lactone with chemopreventive and anti-tumor activities. One of the key processes in which human body eliminates toxic chemicals as well as hormones (such as estrogen) is by glucuronidation. When beta-glucuronidase deconjugates these glucuronides, it prolongs the stay of the hormone or toxic chemical in the body. Elevated beta-glucuronidase activity has been implicated to be associated with an increased risk for hormone-dependent cancers like breast, prostate, and colon cancers. Thereby, aceglatone may suppress the developments of hormone-dependent cancers mediated through beta-glucuronidase inhibition.",
