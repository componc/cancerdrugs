A comprehensive 5 1/2 year series of studies of the effectiveness of vitamin-fluoride products in caries protection has been published. 3-6 Children in this continuing study lived in an area where the water supply contained only 0.05 ppm fluoride. The subjects were divided into two groups, one which used only non-fluoridated vitamin products and other vitamin-fluoride products. The three-year interim report showed 63% fewer carious surfaces in primary teeth and 43% fewer carious surfaces in permanent teeth of the children taking vitamin-fluoride products. 3 After four years the studies continued to support the effectiveness of vitamin-fluoride products, showing a reduction in carious surfaces of 68% in primary teeth and 46% in permanent teeth. 4 Results at the end of 5 1/2 years further confirmed the previous findings and indicated that significant reductions in dental caries are apparent with the continued use of vitamin-fluoride products. 5",
