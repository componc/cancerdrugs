Upon intratumoral administration, mitazalimab binds to CD40 on antigen-presenting dendritic cells, which leads to the activation and proliferation of effector and memory T-cells, and enhances the immune response against tumor cells. In addition, this agent binds to the CD40 antigen present on the surfaces of tumor cells, which induces antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC). This eventually inhibits the proliferation of CD40-expressing tumor cells. CD40, a stimulatory receptor and a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily, is expressed on various immune cells, such as macrophages, dendritic cells and various tumor cell types; it plays a key role in the activation of the immune system.",fdaUniiCode:"Q9J81E7VFM",identifier:"C121538",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Immunologic Factor",subclassOf:["C133877"],synonyms:["ADC 1013","ADC-1013","ADC1013","JNJ 7107","JNJ-64457107","MITAZALIMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FMitazalimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Mitazalimab","","2021-10-30T13:20:10.413Z")));
