Upon administration, anti-CD3\u002Fanti-BCMA bispecific monoclonal antibody PF-06863135 binds to both CD3 on T-cells and BCMA expressed on malignant plasma cells. This results in the cross-linking of T-cells and tumor cells, and induces a potent cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against BCMA-expressing plasma cells. BCMA, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily that is specifically overexpressed on malignant plasma cells, plays a key role in promoting plasma cell survival.",fdaUniiCode:"L0HR9A577V",identifier:"C146860",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C181114"],synonyms:["Anti-CD3\u002FAnti-BCMA Bispecific Antibody PF-06863135",c,"B-cell Maturation Antigen-CD3 Bispecific Antibody PF-06863135","BCMA x CD3 Bispecific Antibody PF-06863135","BCMA-CD3 Bispecific Ab PF-06863135","PF 06863135","PF-06863135","PF06863135"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-CD3Anti-BCMA_Bispecific_Monoclonal_Antibody_PF-06863135",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-CD3Anti-BCMA_Bispecific_Monoclonal_Antibody_PF-06863135","Anti-CD3\u002FAnti-BCMA Bispecific Monoclonal Antibody PF-06863135","2021-10-30T13:32:48.513Z")));
