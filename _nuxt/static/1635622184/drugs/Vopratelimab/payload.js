Upon administration, anti-ICOS agonist monoclonal antibody JTX-2011 targets and binds to ICOS expressed on certain T-cells. This stimulates ICOS-mediated signaling, induces proliferation of ICOS-positive T-cells, enhances cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) survival and augments the CTL-mediated immune response against tumor cells. ICOS, a T-cell specific, CD28-superfamily co-stimulatory molecule and immune checkpoint protein, is normally expressed on certain activated T-cells and plays a key role in the proliferation and activation of T-cells.",fdaUniiCode:"QXN20J93AH",identifier:"C129876",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C141145"],synonyms:["Anti-ICOS Agonist MAb JTX-2011","Anti-ICOS Agonist Monoclonal Antibody JTX-2011","ICOS Agonist Monoclonal Antibody JTX-2011","JTX-2011","VOPRATELIMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FVopratelimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Vopratelimab","","2021-10-30T13:31:16.003Z")));
