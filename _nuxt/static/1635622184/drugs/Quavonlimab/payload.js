Upon administration, quavonlimab targets and binds to CTLA4 expressed on T-cells and inhibits the CTLA4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation. This leads to a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against cancer cells. CTLA4, an inhibitory receptor and member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, plays a key role in the downregulation of the immune system.",fdaUniiCode:"GG0AN49Y59",identifier:"C150679",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C128036","C129822"],synonyms:["Anti-CTLA-4 Monoclonal Antibody MK-1308","MK 1308","MK-1308","MK1308","QUAVONLIMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FQuavonlimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Quavonlimab","","2021-10-30T13:33:25.223Z")));
