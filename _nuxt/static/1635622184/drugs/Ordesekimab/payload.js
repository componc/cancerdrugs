Upon administration, ordesekimab binds to and neutralizes IL-15, thereby preventing IL-15-mediated pro-inflammatory signaling. By inhibiting IL-15-mediated immune responses, ordesekimab decreases natural killer (NK) cell activation and proliferation, reduces T-cell infiltration, increases T-cell apoptosis, and may prevent the growth of IL-15-driven cancer cells. IL-15 plays a key role in inflammation and is associated with a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders as well as with cell proliferation in certain cancer types, such as T-cell lymphomas. IL-15 is required for the proliferation of certain T-cells and NK cells.",fdaUniiCode:"EJ48MR05C3",identifier:"C126841",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:["AMG 714","AMG714","Anti-IL-15 Monoclonal Antibody AMG 714","HUMAX-IL 15","HuMab-IL15 AMG 714","ORDESEKIMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FOrdesekimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Ordesekimab","","2021-10-30T13:30:53.453Z")));
