Upon administration, vibostolimab targets and binds to TIGIT expressed on various immune cells, particularly on tumor-infiltrating T-lymphocytes (TILs) and natural killer (NK) cells, thereby preventing the interaction of TIGIT with its ligands CD112 (nectin-2; poliovirus receptor related-2; PVRL2) and CD155 (poliovirus receptor; PVR; nectin-like protein 5; NECL-5), which are expressed on T-cells, NK cells and certain cancer cells. This enhances the interaction of CD112 and CD155 with the costimulatory receptor CD226 (DNAX Accessory molecule-1; DNAM-1), which is expressed on immune cells, such as NK cells and CD8+ T-cells, and activates CD226-mediated signaling. This activates the immune system to exert a T-cell-mediated immune response against cancer cells. TIGIT, a member of the Ig super family and an immune inhibitory receptor, is overexpressed on tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells and CD8+ TILs and plays a key role in the suppression of T-cell proliferation and activation; it is involved in tumor cell immune evasion, and the inhibition of antiviral immune responses.",fdaUniiCode:"5XO3JF0FEK",identifier:"C140041",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129820","C141144"],synonyms:["MK 7684","MK-7684","MK7684","T-cell Immunoglobulin and Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Inhibitory Motif Inhibitor MK-7684","TIGIT Inhibitor MK-7684","TIGIT-targeting Agent MK-7684","VIBOSTOLIMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FVibostolimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Vibostolimab","","2021-10-30T13:32:19.773Z")));
