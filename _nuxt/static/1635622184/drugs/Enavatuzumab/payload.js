Enavatuzumab binds to TWEAKR and inhibits TWEAK ligand binding and activation of NF-kappaB-mediated cytokine release, which may result in tumor cell apoptosis. TWEAKR is a cell-surface receptor with homology to tumor necrosis factor receptors. Upon binding with its ligand, TWEAKR has been shown to stimulate cytokine release and cell proliferation, migration, and survival; it may also promote apoptosis under some conditions. This receptor may be overexpressed in a variety of tumors including those of the pancreas, colon, lung, kidney, and breast.",fdaUniiCode:"914910XFBB",identifier:"C80045",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C1742","C20401"],synonyms:["Anti-tumor Necrosis Factor-like Weak Inducer of Apoptosis Monoclonal Antibody PDL192","ENAVATUZUMAB",a,"PDL 192"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FEnavatuzumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Enavatuzumab","","2021-10-30T13:45:34.633Z")));
