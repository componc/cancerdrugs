Upon intravenous administration, anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody MEDI6469 selectively binds to and activates OX40. OX40 activation induces proliferation of effector T-lymphocytes. In the presence of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), this may promote an immune response against the TAA-expressing tumor cells. OX40, a cell surface glycoprotein and member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily, is expressed on T-lymphocytes and provides a co-stimulatory signal for the proliferation and survival of activated T-cells.",fdaUniiCode:"AKV2GM43DD",identifier:"C117293",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C96040"],synonyms:["Agonistic Anti-CD134 Monoclonal Antibody MEDI6469",c,"MEDI-6469","MEDI6469"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAgonistic_Anti-OX40_Monoclonal_Antibody_MEDI6469",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Agonistic_Anti-OX40_Monoclonal_Antibody_MEDI6469","Agonistic Anti-OX40 Monoclonal Antibody MEDI6469","2021-10-30T13:19:26.393Z")));
