Upon administration, tRoducitabine is taken up by cells through a carrier-mediated transporter, phosphorylated by uridine cytidine kinase (UCK) and then further phosphorylated to its diphosphate (RX-DP) and triphosphate forms (RX-TP). The triphosphate form is incorporated into RNA and inhibits RNA synthesis. The diphosphate RX-DP is reduced by ribonucleotide reductase (RR) to dRX-DP; its triphosphate form (dRX-TP) is incorporated into DNA. In addition, RX-3117 also inhibits DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). This eventually leads to cell cycle arrest and the induction of apoptosis. UCK is the rate-limiting enzyme in the pyrimidine-nucleotide salvage pathway.",fdaUniiCode:"0Z4A82I0JO",identifier:"C113444",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Nucleic Acid, Nucleoside, or Nucleotide",subclassOf:["C1557","C2150"],synonyms:["4-Amino-1-((1S,4R,5S)-2-fluoro-4,5-dihydroxy-3-(hydroxymethyl)cyclopent-2-en-1-yl)pyrimidin-2(1H)-one","Cytidine Analog RX-3117","Fluorocyclopentenylcytosine","RODUCITABINE","RX-3117",a,"TV-1360"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FRoducitabine",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Roducitabine","","2021-10-30T13:18:37.363Z")));
