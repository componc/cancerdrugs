Upon administration, modakafusp alfa specifically targets and binds to CD38 on CD38-positive tumor cells. In turn, the IFNa moiety binds to cell-surface IFN receptors, and activates IFN-mediated signal transduction pathways, which results in the transcription and translation of genes whose products may cause antiproliferative effects in CD38-positive tumor cells. CD38, a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, is present on various immune cells and hematologic malignancies, and its expression has been correlated with poor prognosis.",fdaUniiCode:"TN8CEX4UT2",identifier:"C140427",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129820","C164008"],synonyms:["Anti-CD38-targeted IgG4-attenuated IFNa TAK-573","Anti-CD38-targeted IgG4-attenuated Interferon Alpha TAK-573","CD38-targeted IgG4 Fused with Attenuated IFNa","MODAKAFUSP ALFA",c,"TAK-573","TEV-48573"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FModakafusp_Alfa",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Modakafusp_Alfa","Modakafusp Alfa","2021-10-30T13:32:20.243Z")));
