Like other ICRF compounds, sobuzoxane and its active metabolite ICRF-154 interfere with topoisomerase II activity prior to the formation of intermediate cleavable DNA-enzyme complexes during the catalytic cycle resulting in tumor cell growth inhibition. Furthermore, sobuzoxane chelates metal cations thereby limiting the formation of free radical-generating anthracycline-metal complexes and may prevent anthracycline-induced oxidative damage to cardiac and soft tissues.",fdaUniiCode:"R1308VH37P",identifier:"C66540",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C1968"],synonyms:["1,2-Bis(4-isobutoxycarbonyloxymethyl-3,5-dioxo-piperazin-1-yl)ethane","MST-16","SOBUZOXANE",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSobuzoxane",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Sobuzoxane","2021-10-30T13:42:57.063Z")));
