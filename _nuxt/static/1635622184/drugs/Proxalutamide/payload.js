Upon oral administration, proxalutamide binds to AR in target tissues, inhibits androgen-induced receptor activation, and facilitates the formation of inactive complexes that cannot translocate to the nucleus. This prevents binding to and transcription of AR-responsive genes that regulate prostate cancer cell proliferation. In addition, proxalutamide induces AR downregulation, thereby further preventing AR-mediated signaling. This ultimately leads to an inhibition of growth in AR-expressing prostate cancer cells. AR is overexpressed in prostate cancer and plays a key role in prostate cancer cell proliferation.",fdaUniiCode:"QX6O64GP40",identifier:"C130036",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C146993"],synonyms:["GT-0918","GT0918",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FProxalutamide",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Proxalutamide","","2021-10-30T13:31:18.363Z")));
