Agerafenib specifically and selectively inhibits the activity of the mutated form (V600E) of B-raf kinase. This inhibits the activation of the RAF\u002Fmitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)\u002Fextracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) signaling pathway and may result in a decrease in the proliferation of tumor cells expressing the mutated B-raf gene. The Raf mutation BRAF V600E, in which valine is substituted for glutamic acid at residue 600, is frequently found in a variety of human tumors and results in the constitutive activation of the RAF\u002FMEK\u002FERK signaling pathway that regulates cellular proliferation and survival.",fdaUniiCode:"78I4VEX88N",identifier:"C107245",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C155322"],synonyms:["1-(3-(6,7-Dimethoxyquinazolin-4-yloxy)phenyl)-3-(5-(1,1,1-trifluoro-2-methylpropan-2-yl)isoxazol-3-yl)urea Hydrochloride","AC013773","AGERAFENIB",a,"CEP-32496","RXDX-105"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAgerafenib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Agerafenib","","2021-10-30T13:18:01.313Z")));
