Cordycepin is an inhibitor of polyadenylation, activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and reduces mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, which may result in both the induction of tumor cell apoptosis and a decrease in tumor cell proliferation. mTOR, a serine\u002Fthreonine kinase belonging to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-related kinase (PIKK) family, plays an important role in the PI3K\u002FAKT\u002FmTOR signaling pathway that regulates cell growth and proliferation, and its expression or activity is frequently dysregulated in human cancers.",fdaUniiCode:"GZ8VF4M2J8",identifier:"C1057",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Nucleic Acid, Nucleoside, or Nucleotide",subclassOf:["C1556"],synonyms:["3'-Deoxyadenosine","3'-dA-CE Phosphoramidite","3-dAdenosine","9-Cordyceposidoadenine","COR","CORDYCEPIN",a,"Cordycepine","Kordicepin","cordycepin"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FCordycepin",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Cordycepin","2021-10-30T13:17:47.393Z")));
