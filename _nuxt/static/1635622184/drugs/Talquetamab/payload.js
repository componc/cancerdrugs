Upon administration, talquetamab binds to both CD3 on T-cells and GPRC5D expressed on certain tumor cells. This results in the cross-linking of T-cells and tumor cells, and induces a potent cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against GPRC5D-expressing tumor cells. GPRC5D is overexpressed on certain tumors, such as multiple myeloma, while minimally expressed on normal, healthy cells, and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation.",fdaUniiCode:"4W3KFI3TN3",identifier:"C171840",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C28227"],synonyms:["Anti-CD3\u002FAnti-GPRC5D Bispecific Monoclonal Antibody JNJ-64407564","GPRC5D x CD3 Bispecific Antibody JNJ-64407564","GPRC5D x CD3 DuoBody Antibody JNJ-64407564","GPRC5D\u002FCD3 DuoBody Antibody JNJ-64407564","Humanized GPRC5D x CD3 DuoBody Antibody JNJ-64407564","JNJ 64407564","JNJ-64407564","JNJ64407564","TALQUETAMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTalquetamab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Talquetamab","","2021-10-30T13:36:09.443Z")));
