Upon intravenous administration, trilaciclib binds to and inhibits the activity of CDK4\u002F6, thereby blocking the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) in early G1. This prevents G1\u002FS phase transition, causes cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, induces apoptosis, and inhibits the proliferation of CDK4\u002F6-overexpressing tumor cells. In patients with CDK4\u002F6-independent tumor cells, G1T28 may protect against multi-lineage chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression (CIM) by transiently and reversibly inducing G1 cell cycle arrest in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and preventing transition to the S phase. This protects all hematopoietic lineages, including red blood cells, platelets, neutrophils and lymphocytes, from the DNA-damaging effects of certain chemotherapeutics and preserves the function of the bone marrow and the immune system. CDKs are serine\u002Fthreonine kinases involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and may be overexpressed in certain cancer cell types. HSPCs are dependent upon CDK4\u002F6 for proliferation.",fdaUniiCode:"U6072DO9XG",identifier:"C123281",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C2185"],synonyms:["2'-((5-(4-Methylpiperazin-1-yl)pyridin-2-yl)amino)-7',8'-dihydro-6'H-spiro(cyclohexane-1,9'-pyrazino(1',2':1,5)pyrrolo(2,3-d)pyrimidin)-6'-one","G1T28","Spiro(cyclohexane-1,9'(6'H)-pyrazino(1',2':1,5)pyrrolo(2,3-d)pyrimidin)-6'-one, 7',8'-dihydro-2'-((5-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-2-pyridinyl)amino)-","TRILACICLIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTrilaciclib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Trilaciclib","","2021-10-30T13:30:01.283Z")));
