Upon administration, tavolimab selectively binds to and activates the OX40 receptor. OX40 receptor activation induces proliferation of memory and effector T-lymphocytes. In the presence of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), this agent may promote an immune response against TAAs-expressing tumor cells. OX40, a cell surface glycoprotein and member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family, is expressed on T-lymphocytes and provides a co-stimulatory signal for the proliferation and survival of activated T-cells.",fdaUniiCode:"4LU9B48U4D",identifier:"C120041",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C96040"],synonyms:["Anti-OX40 Monoclonal Antibody MEDI0562","MEDI-0562","MEDI0562","TAVOLIMAB",a,"Tavolixizumab"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTavolimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Tavolimab","","2021-10-30T13:19:56.673Z")));
