Anti-MET monoclonal antibody MetMAb binds to the extracellular domain of c-Met, preventing the binding of its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF); the activation of the c-Met signaling pathway is thus inhibited, which may result in cell death in c-Met-expressing tumor cells. c-Met, a receptor tyrosine kinase, is overexpressed on the cell surfaces of a variety of cancer cell types and may play a key role in their proliferation, invasion and survival.",fdaUniiCode:"MS1J9720WC",identifier:"C82348",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:["Anti-MET Monoclonal Antibody MetMAb","MetMAb","OA-5D5","ONARTUZUMAB",a,"PRO 143966"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FOnartuzumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Onartuzumab","","2021-10-30T13:45:52.563Z")));
