Upon administration, vudalimab targets and binds to both PD-1 and CTLA4 expressed on tumor-infiltrating T-lymphocytes (TILs) and inhibits the PD-1- and CTLA4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation and proliferation. This restores immune function and activates a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against tumor cells. Both PD-1 and CTLA4 are selectively expressed on TILs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and negatively regulate the activation and effector functions of T-cells. They play key roles in the downregulation of the immune system and tumor evasion from host immunity. Dual checkpoint blockade of PD1 and CTLA4 with XmAb20717 may enhance T cell activation and proliferation more than the blockade of either immune checkpoint receptor alone. The engineered Fc domain increases the stability and half-life of the antibody.",fdaUniiCode:"4I9I5X3Z6N",identifier:"C150463",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C128036","C129822","C28227"],synonyms:["Anti-PD-1\u002FAnti-CTLA-4 XmAb20717","Anti-PD1\u002FCTLA4 Bispecific Antibody XmAb20717","PD-1 x CTLA-4 Bispecific Antibody XmAb20717","PD-1 x CTLA-4 Dual Checkpoint Inhibitor XmAb20717","VUDALIMAB",a,"XmAb 20717","XmAb20717"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FVudalimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Vudalimab","","2021-10-30T13:33:24.283Z")));
