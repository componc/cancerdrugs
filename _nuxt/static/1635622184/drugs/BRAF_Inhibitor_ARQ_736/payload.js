BRAF inhibitor ARQ 736 is converted into its active form ARQ 680 in the presence of phosphatases. In turn, ARQ 680 selectively binds to and inhibits the activity of oncogenic B-raf, which may inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells expressing mutated B-raf gene. B-raf belongs to the raf\u002Fmil family of serine\u002Fthreonine protein kinases and plays a role in regulating the MAP kinase\u002FERKs signaling pathway, which may be constitutively activated due to BRAF gene mutations. The valine to glutamic acid substitution at residue 600 (V600E) accounts for about 90% of BRAF gene mutations.",fdaUniiCode:"Y2H4S74Y8U",identifier:"C94224",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C155322"],synonyms:["AQ 736","ARQ-736",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FBRAF_Inhibitor_ARQ_736",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","BRAF_Inhibitor_ARQ_736","BRAF Inhibitor ARQ 736","2021-10-30T13:47:46.333Z")));
