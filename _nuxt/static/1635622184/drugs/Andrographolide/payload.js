Since andrographolide has multiple therapeutic activities there are several proposed mechanisms of action for this agent. The anti-inflammatory effects of this agent appear to be related to the inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) production by macrophages. This agent may activate the NO\u002Fcyclic GMP pathway and inhibit both the phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLC gamma2)\u002Fprotein kinase C (PKC) and PI3K\u002FAKT-MAPK signaling pathways in activated platelets to inhibit platelet aggregation. In activated platelets, these three signaling pathways are downstream of integrin activation mediated by collagen binding and influence the association of fibrinogen with its receptors. Additionally, andrographolide may exert its anti-cancer activity through the induction of cell cycle arrest at G0\u002FG1 phase and the stimulation of lymphocyte proliferation and activation. These processes could result in decreased proliferation of and increased immunocytotoxicity against tumor cells.",fdaUniiCode:"410105JHGR",identifier:"C61637",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C1327"],synonyms:["(1R-(1-alpha(E(S)),4a-beta,5alpha,6alpha,8a-alpha))-3-(2-(decahydro-6-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-5,8a-dimethyl-2-methylene-1-naphthalenyl)ethylidene)dihydro-4-hydroxy-2(3H)-furanone","(3E,4S)-3-[2-[(1R,4aS,5R,6R,8aS)-6-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-5,8a-dimethyl-2-methylidene-3,4,4a,6,7,8-hexahydro-1H-naphthalen-1-yl]ethylidene]-4-hydroxyoxolan-2-one","(3E,4S)-4-hydroxy-3-{2-[(1R,4aS,5R,6R,8aS)-6-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-5,8a-dimethyl-2-methylidenedecahydronaphthalen-1-yl]ethylidene}dihydrofuran-2(3H)-one","2(3H)-Furanone, 3-(2-(decahydro-6-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-5,8a-dimethyl-2-methylene-1-naphthalenyl)ethylidene)dihydro-4-hydroxy-, (1R-(1-alpha(E(S*)),4a-beta,5-alpha,6-alpha,8a-alpha))-","3-(2-(decahydro-6-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-5,8a-dimethyl-2-methylenenaphthyl)ethylidene)dihydro-4-hydroxyfuran-2(3H)-one","3alpha,14,15,18-tetrahydroxy-5b,9bH,10a-labda-8(20),12-dien-16-oic acid gamma-Lactone","ANDROGRAPHOLIDE","Andrographis",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAndrographolide",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Andrographolide","2021-10-30T13:41:39.673Z")));
