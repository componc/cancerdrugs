Seocalcitol binds to and activates the vitamin D receptor, a cytoplasmic polypeptide expressed in normal vitamin D responsive tissues, but also overexpressed in certain cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer. Mediated through vitamin D receptor, this agent induces cancer cell differentiation, inhibits cancer cell growth and induces apoptosis. In addition, seocalcitol may also induce growth arrest and apoptosis independent of vitamin D receptor activation through mechanisms that are not fully elucidated.",fdaUniiCode:"Q0OZ0D9223",identifier:"C26669",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C39713"],synonyms:["(1R-(1alpha(1R*,2E,4E),3abeta,4E(1R*,3S*,5Z),7aalpha))-5-((1-(6-Ethyl-6-hydroxy-1-methyl-2,4-octadienyl)octahydro-7a-methyl-4H-inden-4-ylidene)ethylidene)-4-methylene-1,3-cyclohexanediol","1(S),3(R)-Dihydroxy-20(R)-(5'-ethyl-5'-hydroxyhepta-1'(E),3'(E)-dien-1'-yl)-9,10-secopregna-5(Z),7(E),10(19)-triene","EB1089","SEOCALCITOL",a,"seocalcitol"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSeocalcitol",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Seocalcitol","2021-10-30T13:38:14.013Z")));
