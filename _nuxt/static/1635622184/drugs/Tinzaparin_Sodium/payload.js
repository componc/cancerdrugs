Tinzaparin is a potent inhibitor of several activated coagulation factors, especially Factors Xa and IIa (thrombin); its primary activity is mediated through the plasma protease inhibitor antithrombin. In addition, this agent may inhibit angiogenesis through: 1) competitive binding of the heparin-binding sites on endothelial cells for the proangiogenic cytokines vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and beta-fibroblast growth factor (beta-FGF) and 2) increasing the release of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), a negative regulator of angiogenesis.",fdaUniiCode:"3S182ET3UA",identifier:"C60810",preferredName:b,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C1742","C2578"],synonyms:["Enzyme Depolymerized Heparin (MW 6500)","Inno-hep","Innohep","LNH-1","Logiparin","TINZAPARIN SODIUM","Tinzaparin",b,"Tinzaparin Sodium Injection","tinzaparin sodium"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTinzaparin_Sodium",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Tinzaparin_Sodium","Tinzaparin Sodium","2021-10-30T13:41:15.973Z")));
