Upon intravenous administration, rosmantuzumab targets and binds to RSPO3 expressed on tumor cells. This prevents the activation of RSPO3, and inhibits both the binding of RSPO3 to leucine-rich repeat-containing G-coupled receptors (LGRs) and the activation of the RSPO-LGR pathway. This may result in an inhibition of both cancer stem cell (CSC) survival and the proliferation of cancer cells in which this pathway is overactivated. The RSPO-LGR pathway is a CSC pathway activated in a variety of cancer cell types.",fdaUniiCode:"VD026R6TCI",identifier:"C122921",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C20401"],synonyms:["OMP-131R10","ROSMANTUZUMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FRosmantuzumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Rosmantuzumab","","2021-10-30T13:29:59.853Z")));
