Solitomab attaches to both CD3-expressing T lymphocytes and EpCAM-expressing tumor cells, thereby selectively cross-linking tumor and T lymphocytes; this may result in the recruitment of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) to T lymphocyte\u002Ftumor cell aggregates and the CTL-mediated death of EpCAM-expressing tumor cells. CD3 is an antigen expressed on mature T cells; EpCAM, a cell surface protein, is expressed by a variety of tumor cells and is frequently found in head and neck cancers.",fdaUniiCode:"ZQQ51B5708",identifier:"C77854",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C1454"],synonyms:["Anti-EpCAM BiTE","MT110","SOLITOMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSolitomab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Solitomab","","2021-10-30T13:44:51.463Z")));
