Upon oral administration, CDK\u002FJAK2\u002FFLT3 Inhibitor TG02 binds to and inhibits the CDK subtypes, JAK2, and FLT3. TG02 also inhibits, to a lesser extent, TYK2, TYRO3, STAT5 and P38delta. This may result in both an induction of apoptosis and an inhibition of tumor cell proliferation in cancer cells that overexpress these kinases. JAK2, often upregulated or mutated in a variety of cancer cells, mediates STAT3 activation and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and survival. CDKs are serine\u002Fthreonine kinases that play key roles in the regulation of the cell cycle and cellular proliferation. FLT3, a class III tyrosine kinase receptor, is overexpressed or mutated in most B lineage and acute myeloid leukemias.",fdaUniiCode:"3VF50SU4RZ",identifier:"C105851",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C1404"],synonyms:["20-Oxa-5,7,14,27-tetraazatetracyclo(19.3.1.12,6.18,12)heptacosa-1(25),2,4,6(27),8,10,12(26),16,21,23-decaene, 14-Methyl-, 2-Hydroxy-1,2,3-propanetricarboxylate (1:1)","SB1317 Citrate","TG02 Citrate","ZOTIRACICLIB CITRATE",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FZotiraciclib_Citrate",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Zotiraciclib_Citrate","","Zotiraciclib Citrate","2021-10-30T13:17:49.413Z")));
