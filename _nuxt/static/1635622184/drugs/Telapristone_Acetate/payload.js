Upon oral administration, CDB-4124 competitively binds to the progesterone receptor (PR) in progesterone-responsive tissue and inhibits PR-mediated gene expression. This interferes with progesterone activity in the reproductive system. As a result, this agent may suppress ovulation and inhibit proliferation of endometrial tissue. Also, this agent may prevent cell growth and induce apoptosis in estrogen receptor (ER) and PR-positive breast cancer cells through a reduction in progesterone levels, ER downregulation and a suppression of the expression of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 2 and 4, ultimately leading to G1\u002FS cell cycle arrest. Unlike some other SPRMs, this agent does not exert any estrogenic, androgenic, anti-estrogenic, and anti-androgenic activities.",fdaUniiCode:"1K9EYK92PQ",identifier:"C104055",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C1891"],synonyms:["(8S,11R,13S,14S,17R)-11-(4-(Dimethylamino)phenyl)-17-(2-methoxyacetyl)-13-methyl-3-oxo-2,3,6,7,8,11,12,13,14,15,16,17-dodecahydro-1H-cyclopenta[a]phenanthren-17-yl Acetate","CDB-4124","Proellex","Progenta","TELAPRISTONE ACETATE",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTelapristone_Acetate",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Telapristone_Acetate","Telapristone Acetate","2021-10-30T13:17:31.003Z")));
