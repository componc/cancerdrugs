Upon administration, alflutinib specifically binds to and inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR T790M, a secondarily acquired resistance mutation. This prevents EGFR T790M-mediated signaling and leads to cell death in EGFR T790M-expressing tumor cells. EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is mutated in many tumor cell types, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization. Compared to some other EGFR inhibitors, alflutinib may have therapeutic benefits in tumors with T790M-mediated drug resistance.",fdaUniiCode:"Q09ZKD19V0",identifier:"C133719",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C2167"],synonyms:["ALFLUTINIB MESYLATE","ASK120067","AST 2818 Mesylate","AST2818 Mesylate",c,"Furmonertinib Mesylate"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAlflutinib_Mesylate",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Alflutinib_Mesylate","","Alflutinib Mesylate","2021-10-30T13:31:46.323Z")));
