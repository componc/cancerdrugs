Within an organism, nanaomycin A is first reduced by flavin or NADH dehydrogenase then rapidly autooxidized leading to the production of singlet molecular oxygen (O2-). The increase in intracellular O2- results in inhibition of DNA, RNA and cell-wall peptidoglycan synthesis. Further, nanaomycin A may have antineoplastic properties resulting from a reduction in DNA methylation by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) and reactivating the tumor suppressor gene RASSF1A.",fdaUniiCode:"8XBV72641V",identifier:"C72594",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C258","C514"],synonyms:["(1S,3R)-3,4,5,10-Tetrahydro-9-hydroxy-1-methyl-5,10-dioxo-1H-naphtho[2,3-c]pyran-3-acetic Acid","NANAFROCIN",a,"Nanaomycin A","OS 3966-A"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FNanafrocin",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Nanafrocin","2021-10-30T13:43:56.123Z")));
