Sonidegib selectively binds to the hedgehog (Hh)-ligand cell surface receptor Smo, which may result in the suppression of the Hh signaling pathway and, so, the inhibition of tumor cells in which this pathway is abnormally activated. The Hh signaling pathway plays an important role in cellular growth, differentiation and repair. Inappropriate activation of Hh pathway signaling and uncontrolled cellular proliferation, as is observed in a variety of cancers, may be associated with mutations in the Hh-ligand cell surface receptor Smo.",fdaUniiCode:"0RLU3VTK5M",identifier:"C82385",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C155725"],synonyms:["(1,1'-Biphenyl)-3-carboxamide, N-(6-((2R,6S)-2,6-dimethyl-4-morpholinyl)-3-pyridinyl)-2- methyl-4'-(trifluoromethoxy)-, rel-","Erismodegib","LDE-225","LDE225",b,"SONIDEGIB","Smoothened Antagonist LDE225",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSonidegib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Sonidegib","Odomzo","2021-10-30T13:45:57.153Z")));
