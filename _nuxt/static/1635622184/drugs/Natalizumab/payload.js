TYSABRI increases the risk of PML [See Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. When initiating and continuing treatment with TYSABRI, physicians should consider whether the expected benefit of TYSABRI is sufficient to offset this risk. ( 1.1 ) Crohn's Disease (CD) TYSABRI is indicated for inducing and maintaining clinical response and remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease with evidence of inflammation who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, conventional CD therapies and inhibitors of TNF-α. ( 1.2 ) Important Limitations: In CD, TYSABRI should not be used in combination with immunosuppressants or inhibitors of TNF-α.
