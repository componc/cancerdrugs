Upon administration, the monoclonal antibody moiety of enapotamab vedotin binds to AXL, which is expressed on the surfaces of a variety of cancer cell types. Upon endocytosis and enzymatic cleavage, MMAE is released into the tumor cell cytosol, where it binds to tubulin and inhibits tubulin polymerization; this may result in G2\u002FM phase arrest and apoptosis. AXL, a member of the TAM (TYRO3, AXL and MER) family of receptor tyrosine kinases and overexpressed by many tumor cell types, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation, survival, invasion and metastasis; its expression is associated with drug resistance and poor prognosis.",fdaUniiCode:"43HH4XYH2N",identifier:"C132017",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129823"],synonyms:["Anti-AXL\u002FMMAE ADC","Anti-AXL\u002FMMAE Antibody-Drug Conjugate","ENAPOTAMAB VEDOTIN",c,"HuMax-AXL-ADC","Immunoglobulin G1, Anti-(Human Growth Factor Receptor axl)(Human Humax-axl Gamma1-chain), Disulfide with Human Humax-axl Kappa-chain, Dimer Tetrakis(thioether) with Vedotin"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FEnapotamab_Vedotin",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Enapotamab_Vedotin","","Enapotamab Vedotin","2021-10-30T13:31:31.523Z")));
