Upon administration, onvansertib selectively binds to and inhibits PLK1, which disrupts mitosis and induces selective G2\u002FM cell-cycle arrest followed by apoptosis in PLK1-overexpressing tumor cells. PLK1, named after the polo gene of Drosophila melanogaster, is a serine\u002Fthreonine kinase that is crucial for the regulation of mitosis, and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation. PLK1 expression is upregulated in a variety of tumor cell types and high expression is associated with increased aggressiveness and poor prognosis.",fdaUniiCode:"67RM91WDHQ",identifier:"C143162",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C177899"],synonyms:["'PLK1 Inhibitor PCM-075","NMS-1286937","ONVANSERTIB",a,"PCM 075","PCM-075","PLK-1 Inhibitor PCM-075","Polo-like Kinase 1 Inhibitor NMS-1286937","Polo-like Kinase 1 Inhibitor PCM-075"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FOnvansertib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Onvansertib","","2021-10-30T13:32:38.033Z")));
