Dezapelisib specifically inhibits PI3Kdelta, which prevents both the production of the second messenger phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) and the activation of the PI3K\u002FAKT kinase signaling pathway. This decreases proliferation and induces cell death in PI3K-overexpressing tumor cells. Unlike other isoforms of PI3K, PI3Kdelta is often overexpressed in tumor cells, especially those of hematologic origin, and plays a crucial role in tumor cell regulation and survival. The targeted inhibition of PI3Kdelta allows for PI3K signaling in normal, non-neoplastic cells.",fdaUniiCode:"2K59L7G59M",identifier:"C107686",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C2152"],synonyms:["5H-Thiazolo(3,2-a)pyrimidin-5-one, 6-(3-Fluorophenyl)-3-methyl-7-((1S)-1-(9H-purin-6-ylamino)ethyl)-","DEZAPELISIB",a,"INCB040093"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FDezapelisib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Dezapelisib","","2021-10-30T13:18:06.653Z")));
