Upon administration, enasidenib specifically inhibits various mutant forms of IDH2, including the IDH2 variants R140Q, R172S, and R172K, which inhibits the formation of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). This may lead to both an induction of cellular differentiation and an inhibition of cellular proliferation in IDH2-expressing tumor cells. IDH2, an enzyme in the citric acid cycle, is mutated in a variety of cancers; it initiates and drives cancer growth by blocking differentiation and the production of the oncometabolite 2HG.",fdaUniiCode:"3T1SS4E7AG",identifier:"C111573",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C168619"],synonyms:["AG-221","CC-90007 Free Base","ENASIDENIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FEnasidenib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Enasidenib","","2021-10-30T13:18:19.523Z")));
