Upon oral administration,itacnosertib targets, binds to and inhibits the activity of ALK-2. This prevents ALK-2-mediated signaling and inhibits cell growth in ALK-2-overexpressing tumor cells. In addition, in cancer and inflammatory conditions, ALK-2 is upregulated in response to increased signaling of pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially interleukin-6 (IL-6), and enhances the secretion of hepcidin, a peptide liver hormone and a key modulator of iron homeostasis. Blocking ALK-2-mediated pathways in inflammation and cancer leads to a decrease of hepcidin expression and restores plasma iron levels, thereby preventing low serum iron levels and anemia of chronic disease (ACD). ALK-2, a serine\u002Fthreonine receptor kinase, is constitutively activated due to activating mutations or upregulated upstream signaling pathways in inflammatory conditions and certain types of cancer.",fdaUniiCode:"22Z53X5LHF",identifier:"C156729",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C61074"],synonyms:["ACVR1 Inhibitor TP-0184","ALK-2 Inhibitor TP-0184","ALK2 Inhibitor TP-0184","ITACNOSERTIB",a,"TP 0184","TP-0184","TP0184"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FItacnosertib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Itacnosertib","","2021-10-30T13:34:26.953Z")));
