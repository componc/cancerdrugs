Upon intravenous administration of pegylated recombinant human arginase I BCT-100, arginase metabolizes the amino acid arginine to ornithine and urea, depleting intracellular arginine, which may inhibit proliferation of cells that are auxotrophic for arginine such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells.
