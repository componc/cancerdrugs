Upon oral administration, D-limonene activates aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1 (ALDH3A1), thereby decreasing aldehyde level. This may protect salivary stem\u002Fprogenitor cells (SSPCs) from toxic aldehydes and prevent or improve radiation-induced xerostomia. Limonene and its metabolites perillic acid, dihydroperillic acid, uroterpenol and limonene 1,2-diol may also inhibit tumor growth through inhibition of p21-dependent signaling and may induce apoptosis via the induction of the transforming growth factor beta-signaling pathway. In addition, they inhibit post-translational modification of signal transduction proteins, resulting in G1 cell cycle arrest as well as differential expression of cell cycle- and apoptosis-related genes.",fdaUniiCode:"GFD7C86Q1W",identifier:"C61714",preferredName:b,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C68542"],synonyms:["(+)-(R)-4-isopropenyl-1-methylcyclohexene","(+)-alpha-Limonene","(+)-limonene","(4R)-1-methyl-4-(1-methylethenyl)cyclohexene","(4R)-1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-yl-cyclohexene","(R)-(+)-limonene","(R)-1-Methyl-4-(1-methylethenyl)cyclohexene","(R)-4-isopropenyl-1-methylcyclohexene","1-methyl-4-isopropenyl-1-cyclohexene","Alda 341","Alda-341","Alda341","Cyclohexene, 1-methyl-4-(1-methylethenyl)-, (4R)-","D-Limonene","LIMONENE, (+)-","Limonene",b,"Limonene, D-"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FLimonene_-",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Limonene_-","Limonene, (+)-","2021-10-30T13:41:42.513Z")));
