Upon intravenous administration, tomaralimab binds to the ligand-binding site on the TLR2 receptor and blocks the activation of TLR2-mediated innate immunity signaling. This prevents the TLR2-mediated production of pro-inflammatory mediators and prevents inflammation. TLR2, a member of the TLR family primarily found on leukocytes, plays a key role in the activation of innate immunity; it is overexpressed in various inflammatory diseases and in certain types of cancer.",fdaUniiCode:"P45C2W27DU",identifier:"C120554",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Immunologic Factor",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:["Anti-TLR2 Monoclonal Antibody OPN-305","OPN-305","TOMARALIMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTomaralimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Tomaralimab","","2021-10-30T13:20:05.283Z")));
