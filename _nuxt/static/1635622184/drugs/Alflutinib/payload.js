Upon administration, alflutinib specifically binds to and inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR T790M, a secondarily acquired resistance mutation. This prevents EGFR T790M-mediated signaling and leads to cell death in EGFR T790M-expressing tumor cells. EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is mutated in many tumor cell types, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization. Compared to some other EGFR inhibitors, alflutinib may have therapeutic benefits in tumors with T790M-mediated drug resistance.",fdaUniiCode:"A49A7A5YN4",identifier:"C180535",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C2167"],synonyms:["2-Propenamide, N-(2-((2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)methylamino)-5-((4-(1-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-2-pyrimidinyl)amino)-6-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)-3-pyridinyl)-","ALFLUTINIB","AST 2818","AST-2818","AST2818",a,"Furmonertinib"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAlflutinib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Alflutinib","","2021-10-30T13:36:42.363Z")));
