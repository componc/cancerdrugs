Dasatinib binds to and inhibits the growth-promoting activities of these kinases.

SRC-family protein-tyrosine kinases interact with a variety of cell-surface receptors and participate in intracellular signal transduction pathways; tumorigenic forms can occur through altered regulation or expression of the endogenous protein and by way of virally-encoded kinase genes.",fdaUniiCode:"RBZ1571X5H",identifier:"C38713",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C155700"],synonyms:["5-Thiazolecarboxamide, N-(2-chloro-6-methylphenyl)-2-((6-(4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl)-2-methyl-4-pyrimidinyl)amino)-, Monohydrate","BMS-354825","DASATINIB",a,"Dasatinib Hydrate","Dasatinib Monohydrate",c,b]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FDasatinib",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Dasatinib","dasatinib","Sprycel","2021-10-30T13:39:40.973Z")));
