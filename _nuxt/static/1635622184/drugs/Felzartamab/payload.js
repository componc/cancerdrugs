Felzartamab specifically binds to CD38 on CD38-positive tumor cells. This may trigger antitumoral antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and may eventually lead to cell lysis in CD38-expressing tumor cells. CD38, a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, is present on various immune cells and hematologic malignancies, and its expression has been correlated with poor prognosis.",fdaUniiCode:"3O9FA4XC02",identifier:"C97954",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129822","C155321"],synonyms:["Anti-CD38 Monoclonal Antibody MOR03087","FELZARTAMAB",a,"MOR03087","MOR202","TJ-202"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FFelzartamab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Felzartamab","","2021-10-30T13:48:41.423Z")));
