Upon the administration of ofranergene obadenovec, the modified murine PPE-1 promoter is specifically activated in PPE-1-expressing angiogenic endothelial cells residing in the tumor microvasculature.  Subsequently, the Fas-c pro-apoptotic transgene, containing the human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 1 (TNFR-1\u002Fp55) and the signaling domain of Fas, is expressed in angiogenic endothelial cells.  Fas-mediated apoptosis is activated via binding of the TNFR-1 receptor with TNF-alpha, which is more abundant in the tumor microenvironment (TME), enhancing specificity and limiting systemic toxicities.",fdaUniiCode:"5Q5PRH05GI",identifier:"C71539",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C1742","C49146"],synonyms:["GT-111","OFRANERGENE OBADENOVEC",c,"VB-111"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FOfranergene_Obadenovec",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Ofranergene_Obadenovec","","Ofranergene Obadenovec","2021-10-30T13:43:41.383Z")));
