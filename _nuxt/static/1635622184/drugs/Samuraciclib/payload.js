Upon oral administration, samuraciclib selectively and competitively binds to the CDK7 ATP binding site, thereby inhibiting CDK7-mediated signaling. CDK7, a serine\u002Fthreonine kinase, plays a role in controlling cell cycle progression, transcriptional regulation, and promotes the expression of key oncogenes such as c-Myc through the phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II. Inhibition of CDK7 may inhibit tumor cell proliferation in certain cancers that are dependent on CDK7-mediated transcriptional regulation and signaling.",fdaUniiCode:"46D4HS9ODA",identifier:"C155652",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825"],synonyms:["CDK7 Inhibitor CT7001","CT 7001","CT-7001","CT7001","SAMURACICLIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSamuraciclib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Samuraciclib","","2021-10-30T13:34:11.693Z")));
