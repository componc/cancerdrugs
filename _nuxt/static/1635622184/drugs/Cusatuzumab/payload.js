Upon administration, cusatuzumab selectively binds to, and neutralizes the activity of CD70, which may also induce an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) response against CD70-expressing tumor cells. CD70, the ligand for the costimulatory receptor CD27 and a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family, is found on a number of solid and hematological tumors.
