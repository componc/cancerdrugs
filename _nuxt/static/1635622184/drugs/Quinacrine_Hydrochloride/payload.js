Quinacrine may inhibit the transcription and activity of both basal and inducible nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), which may result in the induction of tumor suppressor p53 transcription, the restoration of p53-dependent apoptotic pathways, and tumor cell apoptosis. Continuous NF-kappaB signaling, present in many tumors and in chronic inflammatory processes, promotes the expression of antiapoptotic proteins and cytokines while downregulating the expression of proapoptotic proteins, such as p53.",fdaUniiCode:"G6242H2NAA",identifier:"C67059",preferredName:b,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129839","C277"],synonyms:["6-Chloro-9-((4-(diethylamino)-1-methylbutyl)amino)-2-methoxyacridine Dihydrochloride","Atabrine Dihydrochloride","Mepacrine Dihydrochloride","QUINACRINE HYDROCHLORIDE","Quinacrine Dihydrochloride",b,"SN 390"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FQuinacrine_Hydrochloride",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Quinacrine_Hydrochloride","Quinacrine Hydrochloride","2021-10-30T13:43:11.703Z")));
