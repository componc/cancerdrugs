Upon administration of trastuzumab deruxtecan, trastuzumab targets and binds to HER2 on tumor cells. Upon antibody\u002Fantigen binding and internalization, deruxtecan binds to and inhibits Top1-DNA complexes, which results in an inhibition of DNA replication, cell cycle arrest and tumor cell apoptosis. HER2, a tyrosine kinase receptor, is overexpressed by many cancer cell types. In addition, trastuzumab deruxtecan induces antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and causes a bystander killing effect.",fdaUniiCode:"5384HK7574",identifier:"C128799",preferredName:e,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C155712"],synonyms:["DS-8201","DS-8201a",a,"Fam-trastuzumab Deruxtecan-nxki","TRASTUZUMAB DERUXTECAN",e,"WHO 10516"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTrastuzumab_Deruxtecan",extension:".json",createdAt:f,updatedAt:f}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Enhertu","Trastuzumab_Deruxtecan","trastuzumab deruxtecan","","Trastuzumab Deruxtecan","2021-10-30T13:31:07.043Z")));
