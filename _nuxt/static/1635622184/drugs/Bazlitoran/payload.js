Bazlitoran binds to and inhibits the translation of mutated MYD88 L265P mRNA. This prevents overactivation of signaling pathways mediated by toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7, 8, and 9, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) activity, Janus-associated kinases-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling and the production of various cytokines. Together, this leads to an induction of apoptosis and an inhibition of tumor cell proliferation in MYD88 L265P-expressing tumor cells. MYD88, a key adaptor protein in the TLR signaling pathway, is mutated in a variety of B-cell lymphomas, including Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) and activated B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL).",fdaUniiCode:"2U46M95B5M",identifier:"C114975",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Nucleic Acid, Nucleoside, or Nucleotide",subclassOf:["C1291"],synonyms:["BAZLITORAN",a,"IMO-8400","Oligonucleotide IMO-8400"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FBazlitoran",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Bazlitoran","","2021-10-30T13:18:50.533Z")));
