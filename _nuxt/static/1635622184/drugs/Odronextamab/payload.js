Anti-CD20\u002FCD3 monoclonal antibody REGN1979 contains two antigen-recognition sites: one for human CD3, a T cell surface antigen, and one for human CD20, a tumor-associated antigen that is exclusively expressed on B-cells during most stages of B-cell development and is often overexpressed in B-cell malignancies. Upon administration, odronextamab binds to both T-cells and CD20-expressing tumor B-cells, which cross-links the T-cells to tumor cells, and may result in a potent cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against CD20-expressing tumor B-cells.",fdaUniiCode:"8R5CM46UIO",identifier:"C119615",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C141215","C28227"],synonyms:["Anti-CD20 x Anti-CD3 Bispecific Monoclonal Antibody REGN1979","ODRONEXTAMAB",a,"REGN1979","WHO 11035"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FOdronextamab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Odronextamab","","2021-10-30T13:19:49.543Z")));
