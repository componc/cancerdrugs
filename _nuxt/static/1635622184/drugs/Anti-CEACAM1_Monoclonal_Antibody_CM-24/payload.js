Upon administration of anti-CEACAM1 monoclonal antibody CM-24, this agent binds to CEACAM1 on cancer cells and certain immune cells. This blocks the binding of CEACAM1-expressing cancer cells to CEACAM1-expressing immune cells and abrogates CEACAM1-mediated immunosuppression. This enhances the activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells and increases CTL- and NK-mediated killing of CEACAM1-overexpressing cancer cells. CEACAM1, a member of the CEA family of proteins that plays a key role in cell migration, cell invasion, and cell adhesion, is overexpressed by a variety of cancer cell types. Its overexpression is correlated with both immunosuppression and poor prognosis.",fdaUniiCode:"JTP97OR4LL",identifier:"C120305",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:[c,"CM-24"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-CEACAM1_Monoclonal_Antibody_CM-24",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-CEACAM1_Monoclonal_Antibody_CM-24","Anti-CEACAM1 Monoclonal Antibody CM-24","2021-10-30T13:20:00.943Z")));
