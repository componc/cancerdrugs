Upon administration, gamitrinib targets and inhibits the activity of Hsp90 heat shock proteins, such as TNF receptor-associated protein-1 (TRAP1). This induces the accumulation of the mitochondrial kinase PINK1 and the cytosolic E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase Parkin, ubiquitylates substrate proteins, and induces PINK1\u002FParkin-dependent mitophagy. Gamitrinib induces acute mitochondrial dysfunction, loss of membrane potential and membrane rupture leading to the induction of apoptosis in susceptible tumor cells. Hsp90, a chaperone complex protein upregulated in a variety of tumor cell types, regulates the folding and degradation of many oncogenic signaling proteins.",fdaUniiCode:"M6LC47TUG3",identifier:"C180575",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C156880"],synonyms:["17-Demethoxy-17-((6-(triphenylphosphonio)hexyl)amino)geldanamycin","G-TPP","GAMITRINIB",a,"Gamitrinib-TPP","Geldanamycin, 17-Demethoxy-17-((6-(triphenylphosphonio)hexyl)amino)-"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FGamitrinib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Gamitrinib","","2021-10-30T13:36:42.813Z")));
