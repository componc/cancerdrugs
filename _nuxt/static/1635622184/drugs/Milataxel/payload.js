Upon oral administration, milataxel and its major active metabolite M-10 bind to and stabilize tubulin, resulting in the inhibition of microtubule depolymerization and cell division, cell cycle arrest in the G2\u002FM phase, and the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. Unlike other taxane compounds, milataxel appears to be a poor substrate for the multidrug resistance (MDR) membrane-associated P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump and may be useful for treating multidrug-resistant tumors.",fdaUniiCode:"J41Q4S20GS",identifier:"C77880",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C1490","C67437"],synonyms:["MAC-321","MILATAXEL",a,"TL-00139","TL139"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FMilataxel",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Milataxel","","2021-10-30T13:44:54.143Z")));
