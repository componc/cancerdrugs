The antibody moiety of DI-Leu16-IL2 immunocytokine binds to tumor cells expressing the CD20 antigen, which may result in an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) towards CD20-expressing tumor cells; the localized IL2 moiety of this fusion protein may stimulate natural killer (NK) and T-lymphocyte mediated immune responses, enhancing the ADCC response. De-immunization involves the modification of potential helper T cell epitopes that bind to MHC class II molecules; humanization involves combining recombinant murine variable (V) regions with human immunoglobulin light and heavy chain constant regions. CD20 antigen, a hydrophobic transmembrane protein located on normal pre-B and mature B lymphocytes, is overexpressed by various cancer cell types.",fdaUniiCode:"8PQK3QPW4P",identifier:"C78451",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C1512"],synonyms:["DI-LEU16-IL2","DI-Leu16-IL-2",c,"De-Immunized Anti-CD20-IL-2 Immunocytokine DI-Leu16-IL-2"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FDI-Leu16-IL2_Immunocytokine",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","DI-Leu16-IL2_Immunocytokine","DI-Leu16-IL2 Immunocytokine","2021-10-30T13:45:10.293Z")));
