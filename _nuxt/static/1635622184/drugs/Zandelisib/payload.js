Upon oral administration, zandelisib selectively inhibits the delta isoform of PI3K and prevents the activation of the PI3K\u002FAKT signaling pathway. This both decreases proliferation and induces cell death in PI3K-delta-overexpressing tumor cells. PI3K-delta plays a key role in the proliferation and survival of hematologic cancer cells. The targeted inhibition of PI3K-delta is designed to preserve PI3K signaling in normal, non-neoplastic cells. PI3K, an enzyme often overexpressed in cancer cells, plays a crucial role in tumor cell regulation and survival.",fdaUniiCode:"8Z28M5SX0X",identifier:"C123925",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C2152"],synonyms:["ME 401","ME-401","PI3K-delta Inhibitor PWT143","PWT-143","PWT143","ZANDELISIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FZandelisib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Zandelisib","","2021-10-30T13:30:13.273Z")));
