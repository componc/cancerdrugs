Upon administration, relatlimab binds to LAG-3 on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). This may activate antigen-specific T-lymphocytes and enhance cytotoxic T cell-mediated tumor cell lysis, which leads to a reduction in tumor growth. LAG-3 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) and binds to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II.
