As the aglycone metabolite of glucosinolate glucoraphanin (sulforaphane glucosinolate), sulforaphane acts as an antioxidant and potent stimulator of endogenous detoxifying enzymes.  This agent displays anticarcinogenic properties due to its ability to induce phase II detoxification enzymes, such as glutathione S-transferase and quinone reductase, thereby providing protection against certain carcinogens and toxic, reactive oxygen species.  Broccoli sprouts contain large amounts of sulforaphane, which is also found in other cruciferous vegetables including cabbage and kale.",fdaUniiCode:"GA49J4310U",identifier:"C1424",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C45711","C54630"],synonyms:["(+\u002F-)-Sulforaphane","1-Isothiocyanato-4-(methylsulfinyl)butane","1-isothiocyanato-4-methylsulfinyl-butane","SULFORAPHANE","Sulfaforaphane","Sulforafan",a,"Sulphoraphane"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSulforaphane",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Sulforaphane","2021-10-30T13:32:30.663Z")));
