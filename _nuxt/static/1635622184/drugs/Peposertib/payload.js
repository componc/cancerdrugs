Upon administration, peposertib binds to and inhibits the activity of DNA-PK, thereby interfering with the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) process and preventing repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) caused by ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic treatment. This increases chemo- and radiotherapy cytotoxicity and leads to enhanced tumor cell death. The enhanced ability of tumor cells to repair DSBs plays a major role in the resistance of tumor cells to chemo- and radiotherapy; DNA-PK plays a key role in the NHEJ pathway and DSB repair.",fdaUniiCode:"GN429E725A",identifier:"C120036",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C1404"],synonyms:["(S)-[2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-(7-morpholin-4-ylquinazolin-4-yl)phenyl]-(6-methoxypyridazin-3-yl)methanol","3-Pyridazinemethanol, alpha-(2-Chloro-4-fluoro-5-(7-(4-morpholinyl)-4-quinazolinyl)phenyl)-6-methoxy-, (alphaS)-","M 3814","M-3814","M3814","MSC 2490484A","MSC-2490484A","MSC2490484A","Nedisertib","PEPOSERTIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FPeposertib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Peposertib","","2021-10-30T13:19:55.713Z")));
