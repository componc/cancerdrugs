Verubulin binds to and inhibits tubulin polymerization and interrupts microtubule formation, resulting in disruption of mitotic spindle assembly, cell cycle arrest in the G2\u002FM phase, and cell death. This agent is not a substrate for several subtypes of multidrug resistance ABC transporters, and may be useful for treating multidrug resistant tumors. In addition, as a vascular disrupting agent, verubulin disrupts tumor microvasculature specifically, which may result in acute ischemia and massive tumor cell death. In addition, verubulin is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the brain.",fdaUniiCode:"X97O9FTB92",identifier:"C96747",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C25974"],synonyms:["4-quinazolinamine, N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-N,2-dimethyl-","MX-128495","N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-N,2-dimethylquinazolin-4-amine","VERUBULIN",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FVerubulin",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Verubulin","2021-10-30T13:48:24.863Z")));
