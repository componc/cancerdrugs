JAK1\u002F2 inhibitor CYT387 competes with JAK1\u002F2 for ATP binding, which may result in inhibition of JAK1\u002F2 activation, inhibition of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and so the induction of apoptosis and a reduction of tumor cell proliferation in JAK1\u002F2-expressing tumor cells. JAK2 is the most common mutated gene in bcr-abl-negative myeloproliferative disorders; the JAK2V617F gain-of-function mutation involves a valine-to-phenylalanine modification at position 617. The JAK-STAT signaling pathway is a major mediator of cytokine activity and is often dysregulated in a variety of tumor cell types.",fdaUniiCode:"6O01GMS00P",identifier:"C88311",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C172200"],synonyms:["CYT387","GS-0387","MOMELOTINIB",a,"N-(Cyanomethyl)-4-(2-((4-(morpholin-4-yl)phenyl)amino)pyrimidin-4-yl)benzamide"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FMomelotinib",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Momelotinib","2021-10-30T13:46:52.853Z")));
