JAK2 inhibitor BMS-911543 selectively inhibits JAK2, thereby preventing the JAK\u002FSTAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) signaling cascade, including activation of STAT3. This may lead to an induction of tumor cell apoptosis and a decrease in cellular proliferation. JAK2, often upregulated or mutated in a variety of cancer cells, mediates STAT3 activation and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and survival.",fdaUniiCode:"7N03P021J8",identifier:"C95702",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C125450"],synonyms:["BMS 911543","BMS-911543",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FJAK2_Inhibitor_BMS-911543",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","JAK2_Inhibitor_BMS-911543","JAK2 Inhibitor BMS-911543","2021-10-30T13:48:01.583Z")));
