Futibatinib selectively and irreversibly binds to and inhibits FGFR, which may result in the inhibition of both the FGFR-mediated signal transduction pathway and tumor cell proliferation, and increased cell death in FGFR-overexpressing tumor cells. FGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase essential to tumor cell proliferation, differentiation and survival and its expression is upregulated in many tumor cell types.",fdaUniiCode:"4B93MGE4AL",identifier:"C114283",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C155727"],synonyms:["2-Propen-1-one, 1-((3S)-3-(4-Amino-3-(2-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)ethynyl)-1H-pyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrimidin-1-yl)-1-pyrrolidinyl)-","FUTIBATINIB",a,"TAS-120"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FFutibatinib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Futibatinib","","2021-10-30T13:18:43.363Z")));
