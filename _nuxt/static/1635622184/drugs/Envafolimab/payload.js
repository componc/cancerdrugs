Upon subcutaneous administration, envafolimab binds to PD-L1, blocking its binding to and activation of its receptor programmed death 1 (PD-1), which may enhance the T-cell-mediated immune response to neoplasms and reverse T-cell inactivation. PD-L1 is overexpressed by many human cancer cell types. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion. PD-1, a transmembrane protein expressed on activated T-cells, is a negative regulator of the immune system that limits the expansion and survival of CD8+ T cells.",fdaUniiCode:"ES1M06M6QH",identifier:"C129714",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C128057","C129822"],synonyms:["Anti-PD-L1 MoAb KN035","ENVAFOLIMAB",a,"KN 035","KN035"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FEnvafolimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Envafolimab","","2021-10-30T13:31:14.543Z")));
