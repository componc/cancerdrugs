Taselisib selectively inhibits PIK3CA and its mutant forms in the PI3K\u002FAkt\u002FmTOR pathway, which may result in tumor cell apoptosis and growth inhibition in PIK3CA-expressing tumor cells. By specifically targeting class I PI3K alpha, this agent may be more efficacious and less toxic than pan PI3K inhibitors. Dysregulation of the PI3K\u002FAkt\u002FmTOR pathway is frequently found in solid tumors and causes increased tumor cell growth, survival, and resistance to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy. PIK3CA, which encodes the p110-alpha catalytic subunit of the class I PI3K, is mutated in a variety of cancer cell types and plays a key role in cancer cell growth and invasion.",fdaUniiCode:"L08J2O299M",identifier:"C116876",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C2152"],synonyms:["GDC-0032","RO5537381","TASELISIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTaselisib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Taselisib","","2021-10-30T13:19:21.873Z")));
