Vaccination with rindopepimut may elicit a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) immune response against tumor cells expressing EGFRvIII. EGFRvIII, a functional variant of EGFR that is not expressed in normal tissues, was originally discovered in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and has also been found in various other cancers such as breast, ovarian, metastatic prostate, colorectal, and head and neck cancers. EGFRvIII contains an 83 amino acid deletion in its extracellular domain and has been shown to transform NIH\u002F3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblast cells in vitro.",fdaUniiCode:"K3L4X0501F",identifier:"C69076",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Immunologic Factor",subclassOf:["C1663"],synonyms:["Anti-EGFRvIII Vaccine CDX-110","CDX-110","L-Cysteine, L-leucyl-L-alpha-glutamyl-L-alpha-glutamyl-L-lysyl-L-lysylglycyl-L-asparaginyl-L-tyrosyl-L-valyl-L-valyl-L-threonyl-L-alpha-aspartyl-L-histidyl-S-(1-((4-carboxycyclohexyl)methyl)-2,5-dioxo-3-pyrrolidinyl)-, complex with hemocyanin (Megathura crenulata)","PF-04948568","RINDOPEPIMUT",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FRindopepimut",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Rindopepimut","","2021-10-30T13:43:23.793Z")));
