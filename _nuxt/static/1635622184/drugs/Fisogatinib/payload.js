Upon oral administration, fisogatinib specifically binds to and blocks the binding of the ligand FGF19 to FGFR4. This prevents the activation of FGFR4, inhibits FGFR4-mediated signaling and leads to an inhibition of tumor cell proliferation in FGFR4-overexpressing cells. FGFR4 is a receptor tyrosine kinase and is involved in tumor cell proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, and survival. FGF19 is overexpressed by certain tumor cell types.",fdaUniiCode:"5Q7R99CKV2",identifier:"C123826",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C155727"],synonyms:["2-Propenamide, N-((3S,4S)-3-((6-(2,6-dichloro-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-quinazolinyl)amino)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl)-","BLU 554","BLU-554","BLU554","CS 3008","CS-3008","CS3008","FISOGATINIB","Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 4 Inhibitor BLU-554",a,"N-((3S,4S)-3-((6-(2,6-Dichloro-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)quinazolin-2-yl)amino)oxan-4-yl)prop-2-enamide"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FFisogatinib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Fisogatinib","","2021-10-30T13:30:06.343Z")));
