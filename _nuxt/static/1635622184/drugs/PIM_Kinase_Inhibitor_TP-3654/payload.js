Upon oral administration, PIM kinase inhibitor TP-3654 selectively binds to and prevents the activation of the PIM kinases. This prevents the activation of PIM-mediated signaling pathways and inhibits proliferation in cells that overexpress PIM. PIMs, constitutively active proto-oncogenic serine\u002Fthreonine kinases, are upregulated in various types of cancers and play key roles in tumor cell proliferation and survival.",fdaUniiCode:"EOB0N7BOY4",identifier:"C160203",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C61074"],synonyms:["2-((1R,4R)-4-((3-(3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazin-6-yl)amino)cyclohexyl)propan-2-ol","PIM Inhibitor TP-3654",c,"SGI 9481","SGI-9481","SGI9481","TP 3654","TP-3654","TP3654"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FPIM_Kinase_Inhibitor_TP-3654",extension:".json",createdAt:"2021-10-30T13:35:03.483Z",updatedAt:"2021-10-30T13:35:03.493Z"}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("PIM_Kinase_Inhibitor_TP-3654","","PIM Kinase Inhibitor TP-3654")));
