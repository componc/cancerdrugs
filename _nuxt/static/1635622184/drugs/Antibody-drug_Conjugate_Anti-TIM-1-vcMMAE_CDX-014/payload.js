Upon administration of ADC anti-TIM-1-vcMMAE CDX-014, the monoclonal antibody moiety targets and binds to TIM-1. Upon internalization and proteolytic cleavage, MMAE is released into the cytosol of TIM-1-expressing tumor cells, binds to tubulin, and inhibits microtubule polymerization, which induces both G2\u002FM phase arrest and tumor cell apoptosis. TIM-1 is upregulated in a variety of cancer cell types while only minimally expressed in healthy tissue. The linkage system in CDX-014 is highly stable in plasma, resulting in increased specificity and cytotoxic efficacy towards TIM-1-positive cells.",fdaUniiCode:"GJV1PP34M2",identifier:"C129401",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129823","C575"],synonyms:["ADC Anti-TIM-1-vcMMAE CDX-014","ADC CDX-014",c,"Antibody-drug Conjugate CDX-014","CDX-014","CR014-vc-MMAE","CR014-vcMMAE"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAntibody-drug_Conjugate_Anti-TIM-1-vcMMAE_CDX-014",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Antibody-drug_Conjugate_Anti-TIM-1-vcMMAE_CDX-014","Antibody-drug Conjugate Anti-TIM-1-vcMMAE CDX-014","2021-10-30T13:31:10.353Z")));
