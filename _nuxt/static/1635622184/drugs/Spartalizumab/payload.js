Upon administration, spartalizumab binds to PD-1 expressed on activated T-cells and blocks the interaction with its ligands, programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1, PD-1L1) and PD-1 ligand 2 (PD-L2, PD-1L2). The inhibition of ligand binding prevents PD-1-mediated signaling and results in both T-cell activation and the induction of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. PD-1, an immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily transmembrane protein and inhibitory receptor, negatively regulates T-cell activation.",fdaUniiCode:"QOG25L6Z8Z",identifier:"C121625",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C128037","C129822"],synonyms:["PDR-001","PDR001","SPARTALIZUMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSpartalizumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Spartalizumab","","2021-10-30T13:20:14.363Z")));
