Upon administration, voruciclib selectively inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and 6 (CDK6). This inhibits retinoblastoma (Rb) protein phosphorylation early in the G1 phase, which prevents CDK-mediated G1-S phase transition and leads to cell cycle arrest. This suppresses DNA replication and decreases tumor cell proliferation. CDK4 and 6 are serine\u002Fthreonine kinases that are upregulated in many tumor cell types and play a key role in the regulation of cell cycle progression.",fdaUniiCode:"W66XP666AM",identifier:"C141430",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C2185"],synonyms:["2-(2-Chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-5,7-dihydroxy-8-((2R,3S)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1-methylpyrrolidin-3-yl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one","P1446A-05","VORUCICLIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FVoruciclib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Voruciclib","","2021-10-30T13:32:25.903Z")));
