The anti-IGF-1R targeting arm of Istiratumab binds to IGF-1R on tumor cells thereby preventing the binding of the natural ligands IGF-1, 2 and heregulin (HRG) to IGF-1R; the anti-ErbB3 therapeutic arm prevents the binding of neuregulin (NRG) to ErbB3. This prevents the activation of the PI3K\u002FAKT signal transduction pathway and may result in both the induction of apoptosis and a decrease in cellular proliferation in IGF-1R and ErbB3-overexpressing tumor cells. IGF-1R, a receptor tyrosine kinase of the insulin receptor superfamily, and ErB3, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of receptor tyrosine kinases, are frequently overexpressed in solid tumors.",fdaUniiCode:"XLR461MD3M",identifier:"C103863",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C1454","C20401"],synonyms:["ISTIRATUMAB",a,"MM-005","MM-141"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FIstiratumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Istiratumab","","2021-10-30T13:17:29.573Z")));
