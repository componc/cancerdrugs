Upon administration, inupadenant selectively binds to and inhibits A2AR expressed on T-lymphocytes. This prevents tumor-released adenosine from interacting with the A2A receptors, thereby blocking the adenosine\u002FA2AR-mediated inhibition of T-lymphocytes. This results in the proliferation and activation of T-lymphocytes, and stimulates a T-cell-mediated immune response against tumor cells. A2AR, a G protein-coupled receptor, is highly expressed on the cell surfaces of T-cells and, upon activation by adenosine, inhibits their proliferation and activation. Adenosine is often overproduced by cancer cells and plays a key role in immunosuppression.",fdaUniiCode:"HQ700V0X06",identifier:"C172109",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C2139"],synonyms:["A2A Receptor Antagonist EOS100850","EOS 100850","EOS-100850","EOS100850","INUPADENANT",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FInupadenant",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Inupadenant","","2021-10-30T13:36:11.003Z")));
