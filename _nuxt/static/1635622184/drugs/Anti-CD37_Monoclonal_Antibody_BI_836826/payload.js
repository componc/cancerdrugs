Upon administration, the anti-CD37 monoclonal antibody BI 836826 both activates the immune system to induce an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against CD37-overexpressing tumor cells and induces apoptosis in these tumor cells. BI 836826 is Fc-engineered to improve ADCC activity and enhance affinity for the receptor Fc-gamma-RIIIa, which is expressed on human natural killer (NK) cells. CD37, a member of the tetraspanin superfamily of cell surface antigens, is overexpressed on a variety of cancer cell types and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation.",fdaUniiCode:"LB090AB8DB",identifier:"C122833",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:[c,"BI 836826","BI-836826","MAb 37.1"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-CD37_Monoclonal_Antibody_BI_836826",extension:".json",createdAt:"2021-10-30T13:29:58.853Z",updatedAt:"2021-10-30T13:29:58.863Z"}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-CD37_Monoclonal_Antibody_BI_836826","Anti-CD37 Monoclonal Antibody BI 836826")));
