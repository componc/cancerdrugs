Upon oral administration, temuterkib inhibits both ERK 1 and 2, thereby preventing the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)\u002FERK-mediated signal transduction pathways. This results in the inhibition of ERK-dependent tumor cell proliferation and survival. The MAPK\u002FERK pathway is often upregulated in a variety of tumor cell types and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation, differentiation and survival.",fdaUniiCode:"V0Q46LFE6F",identifier:"C131335",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C174048"],synonyms:["ERK1\u002F2 Inhibitor LY3214996","LY 3214996","LY-3214996","LY3214996","TEMUTERKIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTemuterkib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Temuterkib","","2021-10-30T13:31:24.443Z")));
