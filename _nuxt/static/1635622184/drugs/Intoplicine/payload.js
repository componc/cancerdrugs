Intoplicine inhibits activities of both topoisomerase I and II via intercalating DNA helix, thereby hindering the movements of enzymes along DNA molecules during DNA transcription and replication, respectively. Furthermore, this agent stabilizes DNA-enzyme complexes during unwinding processes by both topoisomerases, leading to double- and single-stranded DNA breaks. Consequently, these effects bring about cell growth inhibition and apoptosis of tumor cells.",fdaUniiCode:"FB2CIN6HMI",identifier:"C1495",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C1748","C582"],synonyms:["7H-benzo(e)pyrido(4,3-b)indol-3-ol, 11-((3-(dimethylamino)propyl)amino)-8-methyl","INTOPLICINE",a,"intoplicine"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FIntoplicine",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Intoplicine","2021-10-30T13:33:18.163Z")));
