Upon administration of patritumab deruxtecan, the patritumab moiety targets and binds to HER3. After internalization, DX 8951 inhibits topoisomerase I activity by stabilizing the complex between topoisomerase I and DNA and inhibiting religation of DNA breaks, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and triggering apoptotic cell death. HER3, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of receptor tyrosine kinases, is frequently overexpressed in tumors.",fdaUniiCode:"3XPI7EG4W8",identifier:"C136987",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129823"],synonyms:["Anti-HER3 Antibody-drug Conjugate U3 1402","PATRITUMAB DERUXTECAN",c,"U3 1402","U3-1402","U3-1402a"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FPatritumab_Deruxtecan",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Patritumab_Deruxtecan","","Patritumab Deruxtecan","2021-10-30T13:32:00.053Z")));
