Namodenoson selectively binds to and activates the cell surface-expressed A3AR, deregulating Wnt and NF-kB signal transduction pathways downstream, which may result in apoptosis of A3AR-expressing tumor cells. A3AR, a G protein-coupled receptor, is highly expressed on the cell surfaces of various solid tumor cell types, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, and plays an important role in cellular proliferation.",fdaUniiCode:"Z07JR07J6C",identifier:"C79826",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C2189"],synonyms:["2-Chloro-N(6)-(3-iodobenzyl)adenosine-5'-N-methyluronamide","2-Cl-IB-MECA","A3AdR Agonist CF102","Adenosine Receptor A3 Agonist CF102","C-Ibza-MU","CF102","NAMODENOSON",a,"beta-D-Ribofuranuronamide, 1-(2-Chloro-6-(((3-iodophenyl)methyl)amino)-9H-purin-9-yl)-1-deoxy-N-methyl-"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FNamodenoson",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Namodenoson","","2021-10-30T13:45:26.493Z")));
