INQOVI is a combination of decitabine, a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor, and cedazuridine, a cytidine deaminase inhibitor, indicated for treatment of adult patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), including previously treated and untreated, de novo and secondary MDS with the following French-American-British subtypes (refractory anemia, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, refractory anemia with excess blasts, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [CMML]) and intermediate-1, intermediate-2, and high-risk International Prognostic Scoring System groups.

Upon oral administration, cedazuridine binds to and inhibits CDA, an enzyme primarily found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and liver that catalyzes the deamination of cytidine and cytidine analogs. Given in combination with a cytidine, such as the antineoplastic hypomethylating agent decitabine, it specifically prevents its breakdown and increases its bioavailability and efficacy. In addition, this allows for lower doses of decitabine to be administered, which results in decreased decitabine-associated GI toxicity.",fdaUniiCode:"39IS23Q1EW",identifier:"C164146",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Nucleic Acid, Nucleoside, or Nucleotide",subclassOf:["C1557","C2135"],synonyms:["(4R)-2'-Deoxy-2',2'-difluoro-3,4,5,6-tetrahydrouridine","CDA Inhibitor E7727","CEDAZURIDINE",a,"E7727","Uridine, 2'-Deoxy-2',2'-difluoro-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-, (4R)"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FCedazuridine",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Cedazuridine","","2021-10-30T13:35:39.353Z")));
