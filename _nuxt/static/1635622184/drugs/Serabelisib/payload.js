Serabelisib selectively inhibits PI3K alpha kinase, including mutations of PIK3CA, in the PI3K\u002FAkt\u002FmTOR pathway, which may result in tumor cell apoptosis and growth inhibition in PI3K alpha-expressing tumor cells. By specifically targeting class I PI3K alpha, this agent may be more efficacious and less toxic than pan PI3K inhibitors. Dysregulation of the PI3K\u002FAkt\u002FmTOR pathway is frequently found in solid tumors and results in promoting tumor cell growth, survival, and resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy; PIK3CA, one of the most highly mutated oncogenes, encodes the p110-alpha catalytic subunit of the class I PI3K.",fdaUniiCode:"43J9Q56T3W",identifier:"C98844",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C2152"],synonyms:["(6-(2-Amino-5-benzoxazolyl)imidazo(1,2-a)pyridin-3-yl)-4-morpholinylmethanone","INK1117","MLN-1117","MLN1117","SERABELISIB",a,"TAK 117","TAK-117"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSerabelisib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Serabelisib","","2021-10-30T13:48:57.563Z")));
