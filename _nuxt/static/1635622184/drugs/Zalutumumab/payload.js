EGFR is a cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase, overexpressed on many cancer cells. Zalutumumab selectively binds to and blocks binding of EGF and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-a) to the EGFR receptor, thereby interfering with cellular signaling, leading to cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in tumor cells. In addition, zalutumumab also triggers cell lysis mediated through antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in EGFR-expressing cells.",fdaUniiCode:"DA709Q5020",identifier:"C64620",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C20401"],synonyms:["2FB","HuMax-EGFr, 2F8","ZALUTUMUMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FZalutumumab",extension:".json",createdAt:"2021-10-30T13:42:30.323Z",updatedAt:"2021-10-30T13:42:30.333Z"}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Zalutumumab","")));
