Actinomycin C2 inhibits DNA replication as well as RNA and protein synthesis by various mechanisms including, intercalating into the minor groove of DNA and interfering with the function of topoisomerase II. In addition, actinomycin C2 appears to block the interaction between the SH2 domain of growth factor receptor-bound protein-2 (GRB2) and the Src homology 2 domain containing transforming protein 1 adaptor protein SHC, which plays a key role in the Ras signaling pathway thereby halting cellular differentiation and proliferation.",fdaUniiCode:"719U3YSA1F",identifier:"C95198",preferredName:b,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C204"],synonyms:["ACTINOMYCIN C2",b,"Actinomycin D, 2a-D-Alloisoleucine-"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FActinomycin_C2",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Actinomycin_C2","Actinomycin C2","2021-10-30T13:47:52.613Z")));
