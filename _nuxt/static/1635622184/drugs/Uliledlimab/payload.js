Upon administration, uliledlimab targets and binds to CD73 on tumor cells, thereby inhibiting CD73 activity. This prevents CD73-mediated conversion of extracellular adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine, preventing adenosine-mediated suppression of lymphocyte activity and increasing the activity of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). This also activates macrophages and reduces the activity of both myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T-lymphocytes (Tregs). By abrogating the inhibitory effect on the immune system and enhancing the CTL-mediated immune response against cancer cells, tumor cell growth is decreased. CD73, a plasma membrane protein belonging to the 5'-nucleotidase (NTase) family, is upregulated on a number of cancer cell types and catalyzes the conversion of extracellular nucleotides, such as AMP, to membrane-permeable nucleosides, such as adenosine; it plays a key role in adenosine-mediated immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment (TME).",fdaUniiCode:"3OX1DBR75G",identifier:"C159168",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C176988"],synonyms:["Anti-CD73 Monoclonal Antibody TJ4309","TJ 004309","TJ 4309","TJ-004309","TJ-4309","TJ004309","TJ4309","TJD5","ULILEDLIMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FUliledlimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Uliledlimab","","2021-10-30T13:34:53.483Z")));
