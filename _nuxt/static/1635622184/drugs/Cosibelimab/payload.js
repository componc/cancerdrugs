Upon administration, cosibelimab specifically targets and binds to PD-L1, blocking its binding to and activation of its receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279; programmed death-1). This reverses T-cell inactivation caused by PD-1\u002FPD-L1 signaling and enhances the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated anti-tumor immune response against PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. PD-L1 is overexpressed by many human cancer cell types. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion. PD-1, a transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed on activated T-cells, is a negative regulator of the immune system that limits the expansion and survival of CD8-positive T-cells.",fdaUniiCode:"PNW7GBB44P",identifier:"C151947",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C128057","C129822"],synonyms:["CK 301","CK-301","COSIBELIMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FCosibelimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Cosibelimab","","2021-10-30T13:33:29.533Z")));
