Upon administration, combretastatin A1 diphosphate (CA1P) is dephosphorylated to the active metabolite combretastatin A1 (CA1), which promotes rapid microtubule depolymerization; endothelial cell mitotic arrest and apoptosis, destruction of the tumor vasculature, disruption of tumor blood flow and tumor cell necrosis may ensue. In addition, orthoquinone intermediates, metabolized from combretastatin A1 by oxidative enzymes found to be elevated in some tumor types, may bind to tumor cell thiol-specific antioxidant proteins and DNA, and stimulate oxidative stress by enhancing superoxide\u002Fhydrogen peroxide production. CA1 binds to tubulin at the same site as colchicine but with higher affinity.",fdaUniiCode:"JH6Z94GLUD",identifier:"C84867",preferredName:b,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C67421"],synonyms:["1,2-Benzenediol, 3-methoxy-6-((1Z)-2-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)ethenyl)-, 1,2-bis(dihydrogen Phosphate)","CA1P","Combretastatin A-1 bis(phosphate)",b,"OXI 4503","OXI-4503","OXi4503"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FCombretastatin_A1_Diphosphate",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Combretastatin_A1_Diphosphate","Combretastatin A1 Diphosphate","2021-10-30T13:46:22.253Z")));
