Although the mechanism of action remains to be fully elucidated, Hsp90 inhibitor SNX-5422 is rapidly converted to SNX-2112, which accumulates more readily in tumors relative to normal tissues. SNX-2112 inhibits Hsp90, which may result in the proteasomal degradation of oncogenic client proteins, including HER2\u002FERBB2, and the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone that plays a key role in the conformational maturation of oncogenic signaling proteins, such as HER2\u002FERBB2, AKT, RAF1, BCR-ABL, and mutated p53, as well as many other molecules that are important in cell cycle regulation or immune responses.",fdaUniiCode:"K3BO8V06RM",identifier:"C91068",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C156880"],synonyms:[c,"SNX-5422","SNX-5422 MESYLATE","SNX-5422 Mesylate","SNX-5422 mesylate"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FHsp90_Inhibitor_SNX-5422_Mesylate",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Hsp90_Inhibitor_SNX-5422_Mesylate","Hsp90 Inhibitor SNX-5422 Mesylate","2021-10-30T13:47:16.953Z")));
