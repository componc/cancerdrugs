Anti-ErbB3 MoAb AV-203 binds to and inhibits both ligand neuregulin-1 (NRG-1)-dependent and ligand-independent ErbB3 activation, which may result in inhibition of ErbB3-dependent PI3K\u002FAkt signaling and may lead to inhibition of cellular proliferation and differentiation. ErbB3, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family, is frequently overexpressed in solid tumors and its overexpression generally correlates with poor prognosis and tumor resistance; it has no active kinase domain itself but is activated through heterodimerization with other members of the EGFR receptor family that do.",fdaUniiCode:"841P9W25WA",identifier:"C102535",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:["AV 203","AV-203","AV203","Anti-ErbB3 MoAb AV-203",c,"CAN-017"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-ErbB3_Monoclonal_Antibody_AV-203",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Anti-ErbB3_Monoclonal_Antibody_AV-203","","Anti-ErbB3 Monoclonal Antibody AV-203","2021-10-30T13:17:07.213Z")));
