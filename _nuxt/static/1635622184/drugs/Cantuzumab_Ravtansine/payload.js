Cantuzumab ravtansine is generated from MoAb C242, which is raised against a cell surface superantigen, CA242, found in a variety of human tumor cells. Upon binding and entry, the immunoconjugate releases the maytansinoid agent DM4, which binds to tubulin, thereby affecting microtubule assembly\u002Fdisassembly dynamics. As a result, this agent prevents cell division and reduces cell growth of cancer cells that express CA242.",fdaUniiCode:"RNQ8JQ4R9P",identifier:"C61576",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C129823","C575"],synonyms:["CANTUZUMAB RAVTANSINE",c,"HuC242-DM4","IMGN242","Maytansinoid DM4-Conjugated Humanized Monoclonal Antibody huC242","huC242-DM4","maytansinoid DM4-conjugated humanized monoclonal antibody huC242"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FCantuzumab_Ravtansine",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Cantuzumab_Ravtansine","","Cantuzumab Ravtansine","2021-10-30T13:41:36.813Z")));
