Upon oral administration, unesbulin targets BMI1 expressed by both tumor cells and cancer stem cells (CSCs), and induces hyper-phosphorylation of BMI1 leading to its degradation. This inhibits BMI1-mediated signal transduction pathways and results in a reduction of proliferation of BMI1-expressing tumor cells.  BMI1, a key protein in the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), is overexpressed in certain tumor cell types, and plays a key role in CSC survival, proliferation and resistance to chemotherapeutics; its expression is associated with increased tumor aggressiveness and a poor prognosis.",fdaUniiCode:"Z4HZ70S62Q",identifier:"C121645",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C2189"],synonyms:["PTC596","Polycomb Ring Finger Oncogene Inhibitor PTC596","UNESBULIN",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FUnesbulin",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Unesbulin","","2021-10-30T13:20:15.743Z")));
