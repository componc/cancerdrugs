Upon oral administration, donafenib binds to and blocks the activity of Raf kinase, and inhibits Raf-mediated signal transduction pathways. This inhibits cell proliferation in Raf-expressing tumor cells. In addition, this agent may inhibit unidentified RTKs, and thus may further block tumor cell proliferation in susceptible tumor cells. Raf, a serine\u002Fthreonine protein kinase, plays a key role in the Raf\u002Fmitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)\u002Fextracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. Deregulation of this pathway often results in tumor cell proliferation and survival.",fdaUniiCode:"41XGO0VS1U",identifier:"C118294",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C2336"],synonyms:["2-Pyridinecarboxamide, 4-(4-((((4-Chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)amino)carbonyl)amino)phenoxy)-N-(methyl-d3)-","4-(4-((4-Chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)carbamoylamino)phenoxy)-N-(trideuteriomethyl)pyridine-2-carboxamide","CM-4307","DONAFENIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FDonafenib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Donafenib","","2021-10-30T13:19:40.963Z")));
