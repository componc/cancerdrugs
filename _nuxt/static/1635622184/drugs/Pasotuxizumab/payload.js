Pasotuxizumab possesses two antigen-recognition sites, one for PSMA, and one for the CD3 complex, a group of T cell surface glycoproteins that complex with the T cell receptor (TCR). This bispecific monoclonal antibody brings PSMA-expressing tumor cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) together, which may result in the CTL-mediated cell death of PSMA-expressing cells. PSMA, a tumor associated antigen, is overexpressed on the surface of metastatic and hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells.",fdaUniiCode:"9J6SW7G28J",identifier:"C103827",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Immunologic Factor",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:["AMG-212","BAY2010112","MT112","PASOTUXIZUMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FPasotuxizumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Pasotuxizumab","","2021-10-30T13:17:29.063Z")));
