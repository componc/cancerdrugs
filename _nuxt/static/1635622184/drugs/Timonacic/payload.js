Acting on cellular membranes of malignant cells through an unknown mechanism, timonacic may induce malignant cells to revert back to an untransformed state. This agent may also restore contact inhibition, a phenomenon characterized by the paracrine inhibition of mitosis following the formation of a critical cell mass, presumably the result of cell-to-cell signal transfer. Timonacic may also produce antioxidant effects secondary to its release of cysteine and restoration of glutathione concentrations.",fdaUniiCode:"E5913T3IBL",identifier:"C2354",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C2132"],synonyms:["4-Thiazolidine Carboxylic Acid","4-Thiazolidinecarboxylic Acid","ATC","Detoxepa","Hepalidine","Heparegen","TIMONACIC","Thiaproline","Thiazolidine Carboxylic Acid","Thiazolidine-4-carboxylic Acid","Thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid","Thiazolidinecarboxylic Acid","Thioproline","Tiazolidin",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTimonacic",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Timonacic","2021-10-30T13:37:34.543Z")));
