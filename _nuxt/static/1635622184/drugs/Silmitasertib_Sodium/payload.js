Upon oral administration, silmitasertib selectively binds to and inhibits the activity of CK2. This may inhibit proliferation of CK2-expressing tumor cells, and may also inhibit the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2). In addition, this may restore normal host cell cytokine regulation, prevent cytokine storm and suppress the hyperactivation of the innate immune system. CK2, a protein kinase often overexpressed in a variety of cancer cell types, appears to be correlated with malignant transformation, tumor growth and survival. CK2 regulates a diverse array of pro-survival cellular processes including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, PI3K\u002FAKT\u002FmTOR signaling, hedgehog (Hh) signaling, Hsp90 machinery, hypoxia, and interleukin (IL)-6 expression. CK2 also regulates the activity of XRCC1 and MDC1, two mediator\u002Fadaptor proteins that are essential for DNA repair. CK2 is upregulated by SARS-COV-2 and is associated with SARS-COV-2 viral replication and the development of cytokine storm.",fdaUniiCode:"N1E607PU86",identifier:"C85460",preferredName:b,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C1404"],synonyms:["5-((3-chlorophenyl)amino)-benzo(c)-2,6-naphthyridine-8-carboxylic Acid Sodium Salt","CK2 Inhibitor CX-4945","CX 4945 Sodium","CX-4945 Sodium","CX4945 Sodium","SILMITASERTIB SODIUM",b]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSilmitasertib_Sodium",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Silmitasertib_Sodium","Silmitasertib Sodium","2021-10-30T13:46:27.733Z")));
