Upon administration, anti-CXCR4 mAb PF-06747143 binds to CXCR4, thereby preventing the binding of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1 or CXCL12) to CXCR4 and inhibiting CXCR4 activation. This results in decreased proliferation and migration of CXCR4-expressing tumor cells. In addition, PF-06747143 promotes cell death through the induction of both complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). CXCR4, a chemokine receptor belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, is upregulated in several tumor cell types and plays an important role in cancer cell proliferation, survival, and chemotaxis, and in tumor angiogenesis.",fdaUniiCode:"7TS9C20ZWA",identifier:"C131572",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:["Anti-CXCR4 IgG1 Antibody PF-06747143",c,"PF 06747143","PF-06747143"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-CXCR4_Monoclonal_Antibody_PF-06747143",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-CXCR4_Monoclonal_Antibody_PF-06747143","Anti-CXCR4 Monoclonal Antibody PF-06747143","2021-10-30T13:31:27.413Z")));
