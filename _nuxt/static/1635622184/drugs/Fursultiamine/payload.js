Upon oral administration, fursultiamine inhibits the expressions of octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT-4), SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 2 (SOX-2), and Nanog homeobox (NANOG) in cancer stem cells (CSCs). This may inhibit the proliferation of CSCs thereby preventing tumor cell growth. In addition, fursultiamine inhibits the expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) and subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) in cancer CSCs, which may abrogate resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy in CSCs. CSCs promote tumor initiation, progression and metastasis; they play a key role in cancer recurrence and resistance to chemotherapy and radiation.",fdaUniiCode:"05J61265PX",identifier:"C121852",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C1505"],synonyms:["FURSULTIAMINE","Formamide, N-((4-amino-2-methyl-5-pyrimidinyl)methyl)-N-(4-hydroxy-1-methyl-2-(((tetrahydro-2-furanyl)methyl)dithio)-1-butenyl)-",a,"TTFD","Thiamine Tetrahydrofurfuryl Disulfide"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FFursultiamine",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Fursultiamine","","2021-10-30T13:20:21.343Z")));
