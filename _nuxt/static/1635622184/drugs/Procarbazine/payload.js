Although the exact mode of cytotoxicity has not been elucidated, procarbazine, after metabolic activation, appears to inhibit the trans-methylation of methionine into transfer RNA (t-RNA), thereby preventing protein synthesis and consequently DNA and RNA synthesis. This agent may also undergo auto-oxidation, resulting in the formation of cytotoxic free radicals which damage DNA through an alkylation reaction.",fdaUniiCode:"35S93Y190K",identifier:"C62072",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C902"],synonyms:["Benzethyzin","Ibenzmethyzin","N-(1-methylethyl)-4-[(2-methylhydrazino)methyl]benzamide","N-4-isopropylcarbamoylbenzyl-N'-methylhydrazine","N-Methylhydrazine","N-isopropyl-alpha-(2-methylhydrazino)-p-toluamide","PROCARBAZINE","Procarbazin",a,"p-(N'-methylhydrazinomethyl)-N-isopropylbenzamide","procarbazine"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FProcarbazine",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Procarbazine","2021-10-30T13:42:00.233Z")));
