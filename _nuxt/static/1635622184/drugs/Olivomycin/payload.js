Olivomycin preferentially binds to DNA and can be utilized as a fluorescent marker during the characterization of heterochromatin. Additionally, binding to DNA inhibits both RNA transcription and RNA elongation by RNA polymerase; therefore protein synthesis is inhibited. In addition, olivomycin antibiotics are able to induce apoptosis in tumor cells through a mechanism that has not yet been fully elucidated.",fdaUniiCode:"44003517D1",identifier:"C715",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Antibiotic",subclassOf:["C2115","C259"],synonyms:["OLIVOMYCIN","Oligomycin A, mixt. with oligomycin B",a,"Olivomycins","Toyomycin R"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FOlivomycin",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Olivomycin","2021-10-30T13:43:38.093Z")));
