IL-6 binds to its receptor (IL-6R), activating a receptor-CD130 receptor complex; the CD130 portion of the complex is a signal transduction protein that activates JAK kinases and Ras-mediated signaling pathways, which in turn activate downstream signaling pathways, resulting in the activation of various transcription factors (STAT, ELK-1, NF-IL-6, etc.) and gene transcription. The physiological effects of IL-6 are complex and varied and include hematopoietic, pyrogenic and thermogenic, proinflammatory, antiinflammatory, proproliferative (anti-apoptotic), and angiogenic effects.",fdaUniiCode:"4O4QWG0B3C",identifier:"C591",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:[],synonyms:["B Cell Differentiation Factor 2","B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2","HPGF","HSF","HUMAN INTERLEUKIN-6","Hepatocyte Stimulating Factor","Hybridoma Growth Factor","IFN Beta 2","IL-6","Interleukin-6","Myeloid Differentiation Inducing Protein","Plasmacytoma Growth Factor",c,"Sigosix"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FRecombinant_Interleukin-6",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Recombinant_Interleukin-6","Recombinant Interleukin-6","2021-10-30T13:41:04.893Z")));
