Demcizumab binds to the membrane-binding portion of DLL4 and prevents its interaction with Notch-1 and Notch-4 receptors, thereby inhibiting Notch-mediated signaling and gene transcription, which may impede tumor angiogenesis. Activation of Notch receptors by DLL4 stimulates proteolytic cleavage of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD); after cleavage, NICD is translocated into the nucleus and mediates the transcriptional regulation of a variety of genes involved in vascular development. The expression of DLL4 is highly restricted to the vascular endothelium.",fdaUniiCode:"SF168W7FW0",identifier:"C80041",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:["Anti-DLL4 Monoclonal Antibody OMP-21M18","Anti-Delta-like 4 Monoclonal Antibody OMP-21M18","DEMCIZUMAB",a,"OMP-21M18"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FDemcizumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Demcizumab","","2021-10-30T13:45:33.713Z")));
