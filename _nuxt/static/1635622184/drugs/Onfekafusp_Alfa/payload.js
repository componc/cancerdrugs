Upon adinistration, the L19 moiety of onfekafusp alfa binds to the ED-B domain of fibronectin on tumor cells in the tumor neovasculature. In turn, the TNFalpha moiety may locally induce an immune response against ED-B fibronectin-expressing tumor cells and may specifically decrease the proliferation of ED-B-expressing tumor cells.
