The anti-CA6 monoclonal antibody moiety of SAR566658 targets and binds to the cell surface antigen CA6. Upon antibody\u002Fantigen binding and internalization, the immunoconjugate releases DM4, which binds to tubulin and disrupts microtubule assembly\u002Fdisassembly dynamics, resulting in inhibition of cell division and cell growth of CA6-expressing tumor cells. The CA6 epitope is found on a variety of solid tumors, including breast, ovarian, cervical, lung and pancreatic tumors.",fdaUniiCode:"UFB8CT84JS",identifier:"C95764",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C575"],synonyms:[c,"SAR-566658","SAR566658","huDs6-DM4"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-CA6-DM4_Immunoconjugate_SAR566658",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-CA6-DM4_Immunoconjugate_SAR566658","Anti-CA6-DM4 Immunoconjugate SAR566658","2021-10-30T13:48:09.793Z")));
