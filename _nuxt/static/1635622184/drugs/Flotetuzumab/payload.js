Flotetuzumab possesses two antigen-recognition and binding sites, one for the CD3 complex, a group of T-cell surface glycoproteins that complex with the T-cell receptor (TCR), and one for CD123, a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) overexpressed on the surface of certain tumor cells. Upon administration of flotetuzumab, this bispecific antibody simultaneously binds to both CD3-expressing T-cells and CD123-expressing cancer cells, thereby crosslinking CD123-expressing tumor cells and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). This may result in potent CTL-mediated cell lysis of CD123-expressing tumor cells. CD123, the interleukin-3 receptor alpha chain, is overexpressed in a variety of hematological malignancies; its expression is low or absent in normal hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells.",fdaUniiCode:"0AHT0IC02G",identifier:"C117238",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C28227"],synonyms:["CD123 x CD3 DART Bi-Specific Antibody MGD006","CD123 x CD3 Dual Affinity Re-Targeting Bi-Specific Antibody MGD006","FLOTETUZUMAB",a,"MGD006","RES234","S80880"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FFlotetuzumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Flotetuzumab","","2021-10-30T13:19:25.883Z")));
