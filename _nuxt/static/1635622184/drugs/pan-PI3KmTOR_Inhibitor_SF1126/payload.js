The targeting peptide SF1174 moiety of pan-PI3K\u002FmTOR inhibitor SF1126 selectively binds to cell surface integrins and, upon cell entry, the agent is hydrolyzed to the active drug SF1101; SF1101 selectively inhibits all isoforms of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) and other members of the PI3K superfamily, such as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and DNA-PK. By inhibiting the PI3K signaling pathway, this agent may inhibit tumor cell and tumor endothelial cell proliferation and survival.",fdaUniiCode:"DL0Q912033",identifier:"C85469",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C2152","C2201"],synonyms:["SF-1126","SF1126",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002Fpan-PI3KmTOR_Inhibitor_SF1126",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","pan-PI3KmTOR_Inhibitor_SF1126","pan-PI3K\u002FmTOR Inhibitor SF1126","2021-10-30T13:46:28.823Z")));
