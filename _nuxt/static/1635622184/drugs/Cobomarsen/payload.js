Upon administration, cobomarsen targets, binds to and inhibits miR-155. This silences miR-155 and prevents the translation of certain tumor promoting genes, which leads to the induction of cancer cell apoptosis and the inhibition of tumor cell growth. miR-155, an oncogenic single-stranded, non-coding RNA that is critical to the regulation of gene expression, is overexpressed in certain tumor cell types. Up-regulation of miR-155 plays a key role in increased tumor cell proliferation and survival. The LNA is an RNA analog in which the ribose ring is locked in a particular confirmation that increases stability. Compared to the unmodified oligonucleotide, the LNA-modified oligonucleotide shows increased affinity for its target miR-155.",fdaUniiCode:"3JKW7CI9IU",identifier:"C124225",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Nucleic Acid, Nucleoside, or Nucleotide",subclassOf:["C1291"],synonyms:["COBOMARSEN",a,"MRG-106"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FCobomarsen",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Cobomarsen","","2021-10-30T13:30:17.403Z")));
