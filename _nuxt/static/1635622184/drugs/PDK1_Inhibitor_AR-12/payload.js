Devoid of any COX inhibiting activity, PDK1 inhibitor AR-12 binds to and inhibits the phosphorylation of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1).; subsequently, the phosphorylation and activation of the serine\u002Fthreonine protein kinase Akt (protein kinase B or PKB) is inhibited, which may result in inhibition of the PI3K\u002FAkt signaling pathway, inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, and the induction of tumor cell apoptosis.  In addition, this agent appears to induce the activity of protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), which plays a key role in the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway. Activation and dysregulation of the PI3K\u002FAkt signaling pathway is frequently associated with tumorigenesis and dysregulated PI3K\u002FAkt signaling may contribute to tumor resistance to a variety of antineoplastic agents.",fdaUniiCode:"EX3O2Q61UV",identifier:"C88271",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C1404"],synonyms:["AR-12",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FPDK1_Inhibitor_AR-12",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("PDK1_Inhibitor_AR-12","","PDK1 Inhibitor AR-12","2021-10-30T13:46:45.383Z")));
