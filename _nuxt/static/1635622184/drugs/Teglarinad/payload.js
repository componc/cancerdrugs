Teglarinad is rapidly converted in the bloodstream into an active compound through hydrolytic cleavage of the carbonate ester bond. The activated form inhibits NAMPT, thereby inhibiting nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) biosynthesis and induces a rapid decline in intracellular NAD+ followed by ATP reduction. As NAD+ is essential for tumor cell growth, inhibition of NAMPT induces tumor cell death. NAMPT is an essential enzyme in the synthesis of NAD+ and is upregulated in some cancers.",fdaUniiCode:"NUG9P5GWZB",identifier:"C90746",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C129825"],synonyms:["Pyridinium, 4-[[[[6-(4-chlorophenoxy)hexyl]amino](cyanoamino)methylene]amino]-1-(3-oxo-2,4,7,10,13,16-hexaoxaheptadec-1-yl)-","TEGLARINAD",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTeglarinad",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Teglarinad","","2021-10-30T13:47:16.493Z")));
