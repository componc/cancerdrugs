Gatipotuzumab targets and binds to the TA-MUC1 epitopes expressed on the cell surface of tumor cells, thereby potentially activating the immune system to induce an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against the TA-MUC1-expressing tumor cells. TA-MUC1 is designated to MUC1 epitopes with O-glycosylated carbohydrate-induced conformational structures that are tumor-specific, thereby enabling gatipotuzumab to differentiate between tumor MUC1 and non-tumor MUC1 epitopes.",fdaUniiCode:"85V55ZLV2Z",identifier:"C94220",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Immunologic Factor",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:["GATIPOTUZUMAB",a,"PankoMab","PankoMab-GEX"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FGatipotuzumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Gatipotuzumab","","2021-10-30T13:47:45.863Z")));
