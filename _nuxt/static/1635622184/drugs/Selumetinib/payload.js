Selumetinib is an ATP-independent inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK or MAPK\u002FERK kinase) 1 and 2. MEK 1 and 2 are dual specificity kinases that are essential mediators in the activation of the RAS\u002FRAF\u002FMEK\u002FERK pathway, are often upregulated in various cancer cells, and are drivers of diverse cellular responses, including proliferation. Inhibition of both MEK1 and 2 by selumetinib prevents the activation of MEK1\u002F2 dependent effector proteins and transcription factors, thereby leading to an inhibition of cellular proliferation in various cancers.",fdaUniiCode:"6UH91I579U",identifier:"C66939",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C69145"],synonyms:["ARRY-142886","AZD6244","MEK Inhibitor AZD6244","MEK inhibitor AZD6244","SELUMETINIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSelumetinib",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Selumetinib","2021-10-30T13:43:02.393Z")));
