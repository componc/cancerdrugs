Iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody 8H9 binds to 4Ig-B7-H3 (human B7-H3 with 4 Ig-like domains) and may be used to radioimage and\u002For destroy tumor cells that express tenascin. 4Ig-B7-H3 inhibits T-cell activation and the production of effector cytokines such as interferon-gamma and interleukin-4; it is expressed on the cell membranes of a wide variety of tumors of neuroectodermal, mesenchymal and epithelial origin and is highly expressed on monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mdDCs). In vitro, it has been shown that monoclonal antibody-mediated masking of 4Ig-B7-H3 on neuroblastoma cells resulted in the enhancement of natural killer (NK)-mediated lysis of target cells.",fdaUniiCode:"B6PMV8U3C4",identifier:"C48400",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129819","C1511"],synonyms:["Iodine I 131 MOAB 8H9",c,"OMBURTAMAB I-131"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FIodine_I_131_Omburtamab",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Iodine_I_131_Omburtamab","Iodine I 131 Omburtamab","2021-10-30T13:40:10.803Z")));
