As a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), indomethacin inhibits the enzyme cyclooxygenase, thereby preventing cyclooxygenase-mediated DNA adduct formation by heterocyclic aromatic amines. This agent also may inhibit the expression of multidrug-resistant protein type 1, resulting in increased efficacies of some antineoplastic agents in treating multi-drug resistant tumors. In addition, indomethacin activates phosphatases that inhibit the migration and proliferation of cancer cells and downregulates survivin, which may result in tumor cell apoptosis.",fdaUniiCode:"XXE1CET956",identifier:"C576",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C1323","C54677"],synonyms:["1-(4-chlorobenzoyl)-5-methoxy- 2-methyl-1-H-indole-3-acetic acid","INDOMETHACIN","Indocin","Indometacin",a,"indomethacin"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FIndomethacin",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Indomethacin","2021-10-30T13:41:03.363Z")));
