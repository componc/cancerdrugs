Upon oral administration, niclosamide specifically induces degradation of the androgen receptor (AR) variant V7 (AR-V7) through the proteasome-mediated pathway. This downregulates the expression of the AR variant, inhibits AR-V7-mediated transcriptional activity, and reduces AR-V7 recruitment to the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) gene promoter. Niclosamide also prevents AR-V7-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation and activation. This inhibits AR\u002FSTAT3-mediated signaling and prevents expression of STAT3 target genes. Altogether, this may inhibit growth of AR-V7-overexpressing cancer cells. The AR-V7 variant, which is encoded by contiguous splicing of AR exons 1\u002F2\u002F3\u002FCE3, is upregulated in a variety of cancer cell types, and is associated with both cancer progression and resistance to AR-targeted therapies.",fdaUniiCode:"8KK8CQ2K8G",identifier:"C66240",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C250"],synonyms:["Benzamide, 5-Chloro-N-(2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl)-2-hydroxy-","NICLOSAMIDE",a,"Salicylanilide, 2',5-Dichloro-4'-nitro-"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FNiclosamide",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Niclosamide","2021-10-30T13:42:50.953Z")));
