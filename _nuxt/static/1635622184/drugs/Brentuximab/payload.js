Brentuximab specifically binds to the receptor CD-30, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor super-family, which may be overexpressed on the surfaces of Hodgkin lymphoma cells and anaplastic-large cell lymphoma cells. After binding to CD30, this agent interferes with the G1 phase of the cell cycle, thereby inducing growth arrest and apoptosis in susceptible tumor cell populations.",fdaUniiCode:"C67ORA155P",identifier:"C2007",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C164002"],synonyms:["Anti-CD30 Monoclonal Antibody","BRENTUXIMAB",a,"CAC-10","CAC10","Monoclonal Antibody SGN-30","SGN-30","SGN30"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FBrentuximab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Brentuximab","","2021-10-30T13:37:11.133Z")));
