Upon intravenous administration of etoposide toniribate, etoposide is released after enzymatic cleavage of CAP7.1 by specific carboxylesterases (CE) 1 and 2, which are upregulated in certain tumor cell types. Etoposide acts primarily in the G2 and S phases of the cell cycle. This drug binds to and inhibits topoisomerase II, an enzyme elevated in tumor cells. This results in the accumulation of double-strand DNA breaks, the inhibition of DNA replication and transcription and the induction of apoptotic cell death. The tumor-specific activation of etoposide increases its efficacy while lowering its systemic toxicity.",fdaUniiCode:"A59HL2Q48U",identifier:"C114977",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C1331"],synonyms:["CAP7.1","EDO-S7.1","ETOPOSIDE TONIRIBATE",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FEtoposide_Toniribate",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Etoposide_Toniribate","","Etoposide Toniribate","2021-10-30T13:18:51.523Z")));
