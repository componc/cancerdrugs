Samalizumab binds to CD200, blocking the binding of CD200 to its receptor, CD200R, present on cells of the macrophage lineage; inhibition of CD200 may augment the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) mediated immune response against CD200-expressing tumor cells.  CD200 is a type 1a transmembrane protein, related to the B7 family of co-stimulatory receptors, and is upregulated on the surface of multiple hematologic malignant cells; this transmembrane protein appears to be involved in the downregulation of a Th1 (helper T cell) immune response.",fdaUniiCode:"64EUX713G6",identifier:"C77891",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C20401"],synonyms:["ALXN6000","Anti-(CD200 (Antigen)) (Human-mouse Monoclonal ALXN6000 Heavy Chain), Disulfide with Human-mouse Monoclonal ALXN6000 Kappa-chain, Dimer","SAMALIZUMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSamalizumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Samalizumab","","2021-10-30T13:44:57.983Z")));
