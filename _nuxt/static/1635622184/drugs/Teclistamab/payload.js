Upon administration, teclistamab binds to both CD3 on T-cells and BCMA expressed on malignant plasma cells. This results in the cross-linking of T-cells and tumor cells, and induces a potent cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against BCMA-expressing plasma cells. BCMA, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily that is specifically overexpressed on malignant plasma cells, plays a key role in promoting plasma cell survival.",fdaUniiCode:"54534MX6Z9",identifier:"C136823",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129822","C181114","C28227"],synonyms:["JNJ 64007957","JNJ-64007957","JNJ64007957","TECLISTAMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTeclistamab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Teclistamab","","2021-10-30T13:31:58.303Z")));
