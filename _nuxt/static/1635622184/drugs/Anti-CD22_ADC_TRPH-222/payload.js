Upon administration, the monoclonal antibody moiety of TRPH-222 binds to B-cell-specific CD22 receptors and is rapidly internalized, thereby delivering the payload intracellularly. Upon proteolytic cleavage, the maytansinoid payload binds to tubulin, disrupting microtubule assembly\u002Fdisassembly dynamics, inhibiting both cell division and tumor cell proliferation. CD22, a cell surface sialoglycoprotein, is expressed on mature B-cells and on most malignant B-cells. The site specific and stable conjugation to the payload allows for a higher drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) and an enhanced therapeutic index.",fdaUniiCode:"00NT1ETN9K",identifier:"C156882",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C155713"],synonyms:[c,"Anti-CD22 Antibody-drug Conjugate TRPH-222","Anti-CD22-4AP ADC TRPH-222","CAT-02-106","TRPH 222","TRPH-222","TRPH222"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-CD22_ADC_TRPH-222",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-CD22_ADC_TRPH-222","Anti-CD22 ADC TRPH-222","2021-10-30T13:34:31.753Z")));
