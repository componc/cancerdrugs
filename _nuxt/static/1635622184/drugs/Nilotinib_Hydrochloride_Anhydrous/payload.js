Designed to overcome imatinib resistance, nilotinib binds to and stabilizes the inactive conformation of the kinase domain of the Abl protein of the Bcr-Abl fusion protein, resulting in the inhibition of the Bcr-Abl-mediated proliferation of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells. This agent also inhibits the receptor tyrosine kinases platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R) and c-kit, a receptor tyrosine kinase mutated and constitutively activated in most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). With a binding mode that is energetically more favorable than that of imatinib, nilotinib has been shown to have an approximately 20-fold increased potency in kinase and proliferation assays compared to imatinib.",fdaUniiCode:"K37N7BYX3X",identifier:"C95223",preferredName:b,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C155700","C159198","C159199"],synonyms:["NILOTINIB HYDROCHLORIDE ANHYDROUS",b]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FNilotinib_Hydrochloride_Anhydrous",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Nilotinib_Hydrochloride_Anhydrous","Nilotinib Hydrochloride Anhydrous","2021-10-30T13:47:55.453Z")));
