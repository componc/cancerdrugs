Upon administration, fenebrutinib inhibits the activity of BTK and prevents the activation of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling pathway. This prevents both B-cell activation and BTK-mediated activation of downstream survival pathways, which leads to the inhibition of the growth of malignant B-cells that overexpress BTK. BTK, a member of the Src-related BTK\u002FTec family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, is overexpressed in B-cell malignancies; it plays an important role in B-lymphocyte development, activation, signaling, proliferation and survival.",fdaUniiCode:"E9L2885WUL",identifier:"C116844",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C124801","C129825"],synonyms:["Bruton Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor GDC-0853","FENEBRUTINIB",a,"GDC-0853"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FFenebrutinib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Fenebrutinib","","2021-10-30T13:19:17.633Z")));
