Enadenotucirev has the Ad11p backbone with a large deletion in the E3-region and a small E4-domain (E4orf4) deleted, in addition to a partial E2B substitution by the Ad3 E2B genes. Upon intravenous administration of enadenotucirev, the adenovirus selectively reaches the tumor cells due to the leaky tumor vasculature and replicates in cancer cells; however, it is unable to replicate in normal, healthy cells. This induces a selective adenovirus-mediated cytotoxicity in cancer cells, which leads to cancer lysis. Following the lysis of infected cells, the replicated virus is released and can infect adjacent cells, which both induces further tumor cell oncolysis and may activate, through the release of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and inflammatory mediators from the lysed tumor cells, the immune system to mount an anti-tumor immune response. This further kills tumor cells. This may also stimulate long-term anti-tumor immunity. Although the cancer-selectivity of enadenotucirev is not entirely understood, the virus does not efficiently infect normal cells.",fdaUniiCode:"KX7ZYR6OQW",identifier:"C113786",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C49146","C717"],synonyms:["Chimeric Oncolytic Adenovirus Ad3\u002FAd11p Containing Two Deletions in the Viral Genome in the E3 Region (2444 bp) and in the E4 Region (24 bp) and 197 Non-homologous Nucleotides in the E2B Region","ColoAd-1","ColoAd1","ColoAd1 Oncolytic Virus","ENADENOTUCIREV","EnAd",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FEnadenotucirev",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Enadenotucirev","","2021-10-30T13:18:40.463Z")));
