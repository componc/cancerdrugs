Upon administration, anbenitamab simultaneously targets and binds to two separate, non-overlapping epitopes of HER-2, thereby inhibiting HER-2 heterodimerization and prevents the activation of HER-2 signaling pathways. By binding to HER-2, KN026 induces an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against tumor cells that overexpress HER-2. This results in tumor cell apoptosis and inhibits tumor cell proliferation of HER-2-overexpressing tumor cells. HER-2, overexpressed on a variety of tumor cell types, plays an important role in proliferation, differentiation and survival.",fdaUniiCode:"RHS90QRF9E",identifier:"C162577",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C155711","C28227"],synonyms:["ANBENITAMAB",a,"Anti-HER-2 Bispecific Antibody KN026","Anti-HER2 Heterodimeric Antibody KN026","HER2 Bispecific Antibody KN026","KN 026","KN-026","KN026"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnbenitamab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Anbenitamab","","2021-10-30T13:35:28.543Z")));
