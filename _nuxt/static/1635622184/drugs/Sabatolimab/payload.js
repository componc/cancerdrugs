Upon administration, sabatolimab binds to TIM-3 expressed on certain immune cells, including tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). This abrogates T-cell inhibition, activates antigen-specific T-lymphocytes and enhances cytotoxic T-cell-mediated tumor cell lysis resulting in a reduction in tumor growth.
