Nanatinostat targets and inhibits HDAC, resulting in an accumulation of highly acetylated histones, the induction of chromatin remodeling, and the selective transcription of tumor suppressor genes; these events result in the inhibition of tumor cell division and the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. This agent may upregulate HSP70 and downregulate anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins more substantially than some first-generation HDAC inhibitors. HDACs, upregulated in many tumor cell types, are a family of metalloenzymes responsible for the deacetylation of chromatin histone proteins.",fdaUniiCode:"YTL7A418KQ",identifier:"C78475",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C129825","C1946"],synonyms:["5-Pyrimidinecarboxamide, 2-((1Alpha,5alpha,6alpha)-6-(((6-fluoro-2-quinolinyl)methyl)amino)-3-azabicyclo(3.1.0)hex-3-yl)-N-hydroxy-","CHR 3996","CHR-3996","HDAC Inhibitor VRx-3996","Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor VRx-3996","NANATINOSTAT",a,"VRx 3996","VRx-3996","VRx3996","WHO 10911"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FNanatinostat",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Nanatinostat","","2021-10-30T13:45:11.753Z")));
