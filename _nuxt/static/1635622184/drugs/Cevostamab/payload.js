Upon administration of cevostamab, the bispecific antibody binds to both the CD3 antigen on cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) and FCRH5 found on FCRH5-expressing tumor cells. This activates and crosslinks CTLs with FCRH5-expressing tumor cells, which results in the CTL-mediated cell death of FCRH5-expressing tumor cells. FCRH5, an immune receptor translocation-associated protein\u002FFc receptor homolog (IRTA\u002FFCRH) family member and a B-cell lineage marker, is overexpressed on myeloma cells.",fdaUniiCode:"P86BHN01VE",identifier:"C139549",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C28227"],synonyms:["Anti-FCRH5 x Anti-CD3 Bi-specific T-cell Engager BFCR4350A","Anti-FCRH5\u002FCD3 BiTE Antibody BFCR4350A","Anti-FCRH5\u002FCD3 TDB BFCR4350A","BFCR4350A","CEVOSTAMAB",a,"FCRH5\u002FCD3 T Cell Dependent Bispecific Antibody BFCR4350A","FCRH5\u002FCD3 TDB Antibody BFCR4350A","RO7187797","Recombinant Anti-FCRH5 x Anti-CD3 Bi-specific T-cell Engager BFCR4350A"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FCevostamab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Cevostamab","","2021-10-30T13:32:16.093Z")));
