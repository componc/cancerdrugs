Foretinib binds to and selectively inhibits hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor c-MET and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), which may result in the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. The proto-oncogene c-MET has been found to be over-expressed in a variety of cancers. VEGFR2 is found on endothelial and hematopoietic cells and mediates the development of the vasculature and hematopoietic cells through VEGF signaling.",fdaUniiCode:"81FH7VK1C4",identifier:"C80058",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C1967"],synonyms:["FORETINIB",a,"GSK1363089","MET\u002FVEGFR-2 inhibitor GSK1363089","Multitargeted Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor GSK1363089","N-(3-Fluoro-4-((6-methoxy-7-(3-(morpholin-4-yl)propoxy)quinolin-4-yl)oxy)phenyl)-N'-(4-fluorophenyl)cyclopropane-1,1-dicarboxamide","XL880","foretinib"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FForetinib",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Foretinib","2021-10-30T13:45:36.393Z")));
