Upon oral administration, ibrutinib binds to and irreversibly inhibits BTK activity, thereby preventing both B-cell activation and B-cell-mediated signaling. This leads to an inhibition of the growth of malignant B cells that overexpress BTK. BTK, a member of the src-related BTK\u002FTec family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, is required for B cell receptor signaling, plays a key role in B-cell maturation, and is overexpressed in a number of B-cell malignancies. The expression of BTK in tumor cells is also associated with increased proliferation and survival.",fdaUniiCode:"1X70OSD4VX",identifier:"C81934",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C124801","C129825"],synonyms:["2-Propen-1-one, 1-((3R)-3-(4-amino-3-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-1h-pyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrimidin-1-yl)-1-piperidinyl)-","BTK Inhibitor PCI-32765","CRA-032765","IBRUTINIB",a,b,"PCI-32765"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FIbrutinib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Ibrutinib","Imbruvica","2021-10-30T13:45:51.013Z")));
