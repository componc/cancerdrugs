Upon intravenous infusion administration, icatolimab targets and binds to BTLA. This prevents BTLA-mediated inhibition of T-cell activation leading to antigen specific T-cell proliferation and activation of a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against tumor cells. BTLA, an immunoglobulin (Ig) receptor family member expressed on activated T- and B- lymphocytes, subsets of dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, and nature killer (NK) cells, is an immune checkpoint involved in suppressing immune responses. It mediates inhibition of human tumor-specific CTLs upon engagement by tumor expressed herpesvirus-entry mediator (HVEM).",fdaUniiCode:"D40H7X1YZ0",identifier:"C168617",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:["Anti-B- and T-lymphocyte Attenuator Monoclonal Antibody TAB004","Anti-BTLA Monoclonal Antibody TAB004","ICATOLIMAB",a,"JS 004","JS-004","JS004","TAB 004","TAB-004","TAB004"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FIcatolimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Icatolimab","","2021-10-30T13:35:53.193Z")));
