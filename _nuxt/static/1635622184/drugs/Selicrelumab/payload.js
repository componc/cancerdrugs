Similar to the endogenous CD40 ligand (CD40L or CD154), CD40 agonist monoclonal antibody RO7009789 binds to CD40 on a variety of immune cell types. This triggers the cellular proliferation and activation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and activates B-cells and T-cells, resulting in an enhanced immune response. RO7009789 also binds to and activates CD40 present on the surfaces of some solid tumor cells, leading to apoptosis and decreased tumor growth. CD40, a cell surface receptor and member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily, is expressed on various immune cells and certain cancer cells; it mediates both indirect tumor cell killing through the activation of the immune system and direct tumor cell apoptosis.",fdaUniiCode:"0O39RGI33V",identifier:"C119740",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C133877"],synonyms:["RO7009789","SELICRELUMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSelicrelumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Selicrelumab","","2021-10-30T13:19:52.833Z")));
