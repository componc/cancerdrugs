CDK2\u002FTRKA inhibitor PHA-848125 AC potently inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and exhibits activity against other CDKs including CDK1 and CDK4, in addition to TRKA. Inhibition of these kinases may result in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of tumor cells that express these kinases. CDKs are serine\u002Fthreonine kinases involved in regulation of the cell cycle and may be overexpressed in some cancer cell types.
