Upon administration, onzigolide binds with high affinity to dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) and somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2), and to a lesser extent to somatostatin receptor subtype 5 (SSTR5). This agent appears to exert its effect mainly by binding to D2R to activate the ERK1\u002F2 and p38 MAPK pathways, thus inducing apoptosis and inhibiting cellular proliferation in non-functioning pituitary adenoma (NFPA) and neuroendocrine tumors. By binding to SSTR2, this agent may inhibit the secretion of growth hormone (GH) by the pituitary gland.",fdaUniiCode:"L32IM11DV4",identifier:"C88345",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129839"],synonyms:["BIM-23A760","Dopamine-Somatostatin Chimeric Molecule TBR-760","ONZIGOLIDE",a,"TBR 760","TBR-760","TBR760"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FOnzigolide",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Onzigolide","","2021-10-30T13:46:59.093Z")));
