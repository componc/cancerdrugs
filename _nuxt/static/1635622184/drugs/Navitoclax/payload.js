Navitoclax selectively binds to apoptosis suppressor proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bcl-w, which are frequently overexpressed in a wide variety of cancers, including those of the lymph, breast, lung, prostate, and colon, and are linked to tumor drug resistance. Inhibition of these apoptosis suppressors prevents their binding to the apoptotic effectors Bax and Bak proteins, thereby triggering apoptotic processes in cells overexpressing Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bcl-w. This eventually reduces tumor cell proliferation.",fdaUniiCode:"XKJ5VVK2WD",identifier:"C64776",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C159200"],synonyms:["A-855071.0","ABT-263","BcI-2 Family Protein Inhibitor ABT-263","NAVITOCLAX",a,"navitoclax"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FNavitoclax",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Navitoclax","2021-10-30T13:42:37.273Z")));
