Upon administration, the antibody moiety of immunocytokine NHS-IL12 binds to DNA released from necrotic tumor cells located primarily at the core of necrotic solid tumors, thereby delivering the IL-12 moiety. In turn, the IL-12 moiety of this agent stimulates the host immune system to mount an immune response against tumor cells, thereby inhibiting tumor growth. IL-12 is a proinflammatory cytokine with numerous immunoregulatory functions and may augment host immune responses to tumor cells. By targeting tumor cells, NHS-IL-12 may reduce the toxicity associated with systemic administration of recombinant human IL-12.",fdaUniiCode:"KF6D9Z1MER",identifier:"C97961",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C1512"],synonyms:["IMMUNOCYTOKINE NHS-IL12",c,"M-9241","M9241","NHS-IL-12","NHS-IL12"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FImmunocytokine_NHS-IL12",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Immunocytokine_NHS-IL12","","Immunocytokine NHS-IL12","2021-10-30T13:48:42.383Z")));
