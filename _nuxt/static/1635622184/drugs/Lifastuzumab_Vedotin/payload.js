Upon administration, the monoclonal antibody moiety of DNIB0600A binds to NaPi2b-expressing tumor cells and is internalized, thereby delivering MMAE intracellularly. Proteolytic cleavage releases MMAE, which then binds to tubulin and inhibits its polymerization, resulting in G2\u002FM phase arrest and tumor cell apoptosis. NaPi2b, a tumor-associated antigen (TAA), overexpressed in a variety of cancer cell types, plays a key role in transport of inorganic phosphate and the maintenance of phosphate homeostasis.",fdaUniiCode:"7IUT83FK6S",identifier:"C116747",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129823","C575"],synonyms:["ADC DNIB0600A","DNIB0600A","LIFASTUZUMAB VEDOTIN",c,"RG-7599"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FLifastuzumab_Vedotin",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Lifastuzumab_Vedotin","","Lifastuzumab Vedotin","2021-10-30T13:19:15.293Z")));
