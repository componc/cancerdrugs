Upon administration, the monoclonal antibody CR011 moiety binds to glycoprotein nmb (GPNMB), expressed on the surfaces of a variety of cancer cell types; upon endocytosis, the synthetic dolastin analogue MMAE is released via enzymatic cleavage into the tumor cell cytosol, where it binds to tubulin and inhibits tubulin polymerization, which may result in G2\u002FM phase arrest and apoptosis. The vc linkage system is highly stable in serum, rendering the cytotoxicity of glembatumumab vedotin specific for GPNMB-positive cells. GPNMB is a transmembrane protein overexpressed on the surfaces of various cancer cell types, including melanoma, breast, and prostate cancer cells.",fdaUniiCode:"1568H6A58U",identifier:"C78449",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129823","C575"],synonyms:["Antibody-Drug Conjugate CR011-vcMMAE","CDX-011","CR011-vcMMAE","CR011-vcMMAE Immunotoxin","GLEMBATUMUMAB VEDOTIN",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FGlembatumumab_Vedotin",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Glembatumumab_Vedotin","","Glembatumumab Vedotin","2021-10-30T13:45:09.843Z")));
