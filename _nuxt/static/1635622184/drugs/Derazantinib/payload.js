Derazantinib binds to and potently inhibits the activity of FGFR subtypes 1, 2 and 3. This may result in the inhibition of FGFR-mediated signal transduction pathways, tumor cell proliferation, tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell death in FGFR-overexpressing tumor cells. FGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase, is upregulated in many tumor cell types and plays a key role in tumor cellular proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis and survival.",fdaUniiCode:"N9B0H171MJ",identifier:"C104267",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C1967"],synonyms:["ARQ 087","ARQ-087","DERAZANTINIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FDerazantinib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Derazantinib","","2021-10-30T13:17:34.073Z")));
