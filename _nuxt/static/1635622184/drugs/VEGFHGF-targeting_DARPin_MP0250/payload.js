Compared to antibodies, DARPins are small in size, have favorable pharmacokinetics and allow for both high affinity binding and efficacy. Upon administration, the VEGF\u002FHGF-targeting DARPin MP0250 binds to and inhibits both HGF and VEGF. This prevents HGF- and VEGF-mediated signaling, and inhibits the growth of HGF\u002FVEGF-overexpressing tumor cells. This agent also prevents osteolysis, due to the inhibitory effect on HGF signaling. HGF and VEGF are overexpressed in a variety of cancer cell types and are associated with increased cell proliferation, migration and adhesion.",fdaUniiCode:"UGI01OSA4N",identifier:"C117236",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129824","C1742"],synonyms:["Bispecific VEGF\u002FHGF-targeting Darpin","MP-0250","MP0250",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FVEGFHGF-targeting_DARPin_MP0250",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","VEGFHGF-targeting_DARPin_MP0250","VEGF\u002FHGF-targeting DARPin MP0250","2021-10-30T13:19:25.403Z")));
