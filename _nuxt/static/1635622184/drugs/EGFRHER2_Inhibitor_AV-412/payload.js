EGFR\u002FHER2 inhibitor AV-412 binds to and inhibits the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which may result in the inhibition of tumor growth and angiogenesis, and tumor regression in EGFR\u002FHER2-expressing tumors. This agent may be active against EGFR\u002FHER2-expressing tumor cells that are resistant to first-generation kinase inhibitors.
