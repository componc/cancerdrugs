Delanzomib represses the proteasomal degradation of a variety of proteins, including inhibitory kappaBalpha (IkappaBalpha), resulting in the cytoplasmic sequestration of the transcription factor NF-kappaB; inhibition of NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and transcriptional up-regulation of a variety of cell growth-promoting factors; and apoptotic cell death in susceptible tumor cell populations. In vitro studies indicate that this agent exhibits a favorable cytotoxicity profile toward normal human epithelial cells, bone marrow progenitors, and bone marrow-derived stromal cells relative to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. The intracellular protein IkappaBalpha functions as a primary inhibitor of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-kappaB.",fdaUniiCode:"6IF28942WO",identifier:"C74075",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C2160"],synonyms:["((1R)-1-((2S,3R)-3-hydroxy-2-(6-phenylpyridine-2-carboxamido)butanamido)-3-methylbutyl)boronic Acid","CEP 18770","CEP-18770","CT-47098","DELANZOMIB",a,"NPH-007098","NPH007098","Proteasome Inhibitor CEP 18770"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FDelanzomib",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Delanzomib","2021-10-30T13:44:21.253Z")));
