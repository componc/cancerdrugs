Although the precise mechanism of action is unknown, hydroxychloroquine may suppress immune function by interfering with the processing and presentation of antigens and the production of cytokines. As a lysosomotropic agent, hydroxychloroquine raises intralysosomal pH, impairing autophagic protein degradation; hydroxychloroquine-mediated accumulation of ineffective autophagosomes may result in cell death in tumor cells reliant on autophagy for survival.  In addition, this agent is highly active against the erythrocytic forms of P. vivax and malariae and most strains of P. falciparum but not the gametocytes of P. falciparum.",fdaUniiCode:"4QWG6N8QKH",identifier:"C557",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C271"],synonyms:["HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE",a,"hydroxychloroquine"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FHydroxychloroquine",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Hydroxychloroquine","2021-10-30T13:40:45.363Z")));
