Upon administration, tesidolumab targets and binds to C5, thereby preventing both C5 convertase-mediated cleavage of C5 and the formation of C5a and C5b. This inhibits C5-mediated signal transduction, the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) and the activation of the terminal complement pathway, and results in the prevention and\u002For inhibition of both complement-mediated inflammation and cell destruction.
