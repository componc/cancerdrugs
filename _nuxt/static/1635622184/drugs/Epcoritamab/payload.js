Epcoritamab contains two antigen-recognition sites: one for human CD3, a T-cell surface antigen, and one for human CD20, a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) that is exclusively expressed on B-cells during most stages of B-cell development and is often overexpressed in B-cell malignancies. Upon administration, epcoritamab binds to both T-cells and CD20-expressing B-lineage tumor cells. The resulting cross-linkage may trigger a potent cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against the CD20-expressing tumor B-cells.",fdaUniiCode:"D6OMY2L0WA",identifier:"C163022",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C141215","C28227"],synonyms:["Anti-CD20\u002FCD3 Bispecific Antibody GEN3013","DuoBody-CD3xCD20","EPCORITAMAB",a,"GEN 3013","GEN-3013","GEN3013"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FEpcoritamab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Epcoritamab","","2021-10-30T13:35:32.643Z")));
