Upon administration, roflumilast and its active metabolite roflumilast N-oxide selectively and competitively bind to and inhibit PDE4, which leads to an increase of both intracellular levels of cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cAMP-mediated signaling. cAMP prevents phosphorylation of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and abrogates activation of the PI3K\u002FAKT\u002FmTOR signaling pathway, which may result in the induction of apoptosis. PDE4, a member of the PDE superfamily that hydrolyses cAMP and 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) to their inactive 5' monophosphates, is upregulated in a variety of cancers and may contribute to chemoresistance; it also plays a key role in inflammation, especially in inflammatory airway diseases.",fdaUniiCode:"0P6C6ZOP5U",identifier:"C76890",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C744"],synonyms:["3-Cyclopropylmethoxy-N-(3,5-dichloropyridin-4-yl)-4-(difluoromethoxy)benzamide","B9302-107","BY217","BYK20869",c,"ROFLUMILAST",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FRoflumilast",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Roflumilast","roflumilast","Daliresp","2021-10-30T13:44:41.043Z")));
