Savolitinib selectively binds to and inhibits the activation of c-Met in an ATP-competitive manner, and disrupts c-Met signal transduction pathways. This may result in cell growth inhibition in tumors that overexpress the c-Met protein. C-Met encodes the hepatocyte growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase and plays an important role in tumor cell proliferation, survival, invasion, and metastasis, and tumor angiogenesis; this protein is overexpressed or mutated in a variety of cancers.",fdaUniiCode:"2A2DA6857R",identifier:"C104732",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C1742","C1967"],synonyms:["AZD 6094","AZD6094","HMPL-504","SAVOLITINIB",a,"Volitinib"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSavolitinib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Savolitinib","","2021-10-30T13:17:37.693Z")));
