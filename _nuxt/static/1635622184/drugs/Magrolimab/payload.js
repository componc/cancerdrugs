Upon administration, magrolimab selectively binds to CD47 expressed on tumor cells and blocks the interaction of CD47 with its ligand signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPa), a protein expressed on phagocytic cells. This prevents CD47\u002FSIRPa-mediated signaling, allows the activation of macrophages, through the induction of pro-phagocytic signaling mediated by calreticulin, which is specifically expressed on the surface of tumor cells, and results in specific tumor cell phagocytosis. In addition, blocking CD47 signaling activates an anti-tumor T-lymphocyte immune response and T-mediated cell killing. CD47, a tumor associated antigen expressed on normal, healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), is overexpressed on the surface of a variety of cancer cells. Expression of CD47, and interaction with SIRP-alpha, leads to inhibition of macrophages and protects cancer cells from phagocytosis thereby allowing cancer cells to proliferate.",fdaUniiCode:"90YIEHRFJ9",identifier:"C117730",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Immunologic Factor",subclassOf:["C159583"],synonyms:["Hu5F9-G4","MAGROLIMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FMagrolimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Magrolimab","","2021-10-30T13:19:29.143Z")));
