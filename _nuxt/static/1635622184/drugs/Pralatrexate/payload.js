Pralatrexate selectively enters cells expressing RFC-1; intracellularly, this agent is highly polyglutamylated and competes for the folate binding site of DHFR, blocking tetrahydrofolate synthesis, which may result in depletion of nucleotide precursors; inhibition of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis; and apoptotic tumor cell death. Efficient intracellular polyglutamylation of pralatrexate results in higher intracellular concentrations compared to non-polyglutamylated pralatrexate, which is more readily effuxed by the MRP (multidrug resistance protein) drug efflux pump. RFC-1, an oncofetal protein expressed at highest levels during embryonic development, may be over-expressed on the cell surfaces of various cancer cell types.",fdaUniiCode:"A8Q8I19Q20",identifier:"C2250",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C2153","C511"],synonyms:["(2S)-2-[[4-[(1RS)-1-[(2, 4-Diaminopteridin-6-yl)methyl]but-3-ynyl]benzoyl]amino]pentanedioic Acid","10-Propargyl-10-Deazaaminopterin","10-propargyl-10-deazaaminopterin","FOLOTYN",b,"N-(4-{1-[(2,4-Diaminopteridin-6-yl)methyl]but-3-yn-1-yl}benzoyl)-L-glutamic Acid","PDX","PRALATREXATE",a,"pralatrexate"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FPralatrexate",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Pralatrexate","Folotyn","","2021-10-30T13:37:26.333Z")));
