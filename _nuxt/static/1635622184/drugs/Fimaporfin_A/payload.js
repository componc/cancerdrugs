Upon administration, fimaporfin A incorporates into the cell's endosome and lysosome membranes. Subsequently, cytotoxic agents are administered and accumulate in endosomal and lysosomal compartments; upon local activation by light, fimaporfin A produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as singlet oxygen, damaging endo\u002Flysosomal membranes and accumulated cytotoxic agents are released into the tumor cell cytosol.
