Upon administration, lazertinib specifically and irreversibly binds to and inhibits selective EGFR mutants, which prevents EGFR mutant-mediated signaling and leads to cell death in EGFR mutant-expressing tumor cells. Lazertinib may inhibit programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) and inflammatory cytokines in specific cancer cells harboring certain EGFR mutations. Compared to some other EGFR inhibitors, lazertinib may have therapeutic benefits in tumors with T790M- or L858R-mediated drug resistance. In addition, lazertinib penetrates the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This agent shows minimal activity against wild-type EGFR (wtEGFR), and does not cause dose-limiting toxicities, which occur during the use of non-selective EGFR inhibitors and inhibit wtEGFR. EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) mutated in many tumor cell types, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization.",fdaUniiCode:"4A2Y23XK11",identifier:"C148147",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C129825","C2167"],synonyms:["GNS-1480","LAZERTINIB",a,"N-{5-[(4-{4-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-3-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl}pyrimidin-2-yl)amino]-4-methoxy-2-(morpholin-4-yl)phenyl}prop-2-enamide","YH 25448","YH-25448","YH25448"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FLazertinib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Lazertinib","","2021-10-30T13:33:09.093Z")));
