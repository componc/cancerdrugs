Neratinib binds to the HER-2 receptor irreversibly, thereby reducing autophosphorylation in cells, apparently by targeting a cysteine residue in the ATP-binding pocket of the receptor. Treatment of cells with this agent results in inhibition of downstream signal transduction events and cell cycle regulatory pathways; arrest at the G1-S (Gap 1\u002FDNA synthesis)-phase transition of the cell division cycle; and ultimately decreased cellular proliferation. Neratinib also inhibits the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase and the proliferation of EGFR-dependent cells.",fdaUniiCode:"JJH94R3PWB",identifier:"C49094",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C159156"],synonyms:["(2E)-N-(4-((3-chloro-4-((pyridin-2-yl)methoxy)phenyl)amino)-3-cyano-7-ethoxyquinolin-6-yl)-4-(dimethylamino)but-2-enamide","2-Butenamide, N-(4-((3-chloro-4-(2-pyridinylmethoxy)phenyl)amino)-3-cyano-7-ethoxy-6-quinolinyl)-4-(dimethylamino)-, (2E)-","HKI 272","HKI-272","NERATINIB",a,"PB 272","PB-272"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FNeratinib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Neratinib","neratinib","2021-10-30T13:40:23.373Z")));
