Upon intravenous administration of zenocutuzumab, the bispecific antibody docks on HER2, and subsequently blocks heregulin-stimulated proliferation of tumor cells by binding HER3. In addition to inhibiting HER3-dependent signaling, simultaneous targeting of HER2 and HER3 by zenocutuzumab may overcome a common resistance mechanism driven by heregulin-mediated dimerization of HER2 and HER3. Zenocutuzumab is expected to eliminate tumor cells by recruiting natural killer (NK) cells to tumor cells coated with the bispecific antibody.",fdaUniiCode:"AE72RB1W1X",identifier:"C152948",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C155711","C28227"],synonyms:["Anti-HER2 x Anti-HER3 Bispecific Monoclonal Antibody MCLA-128","Anti-HER2\u002FAnti-HER3 Bispecific Monoclonal Antibody MCLA-128","MCLA 128","MCLA-128","MCLA128","ZENOCUTUZUMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FZenocutuzumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Zenocutuzumab","","2021-10-30T13:33:57.903Z")));
