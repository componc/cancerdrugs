PI3K-delta inhibitor TGR-1202 inhibits PI3K and prevents the activation of the PI3K\u002FAKT kinase signaling pathway. This decreases proliferation and induces cell death in susceptible tumor cells.  Unlike other isoforms of PI3K, PI3K-delta is expressed primarily in tumor cells and cells of the hematopoietic lineage. The targeted inhibition of PI3K-delta allows for PI3K signaling in normal, non-neoplastic cells. PI3K, an enzyme often overexpressed in cancer cells, plays a crucial role in tumor cell regulation and survival.",fdaUniiCode:"38073MQB2A",identifier:"C104413",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C2152"],synonyms:["2-((1S)-1-(4-Amino-3-(3-fluoro-4-(1-methylethoxy)phenyl)-1H-pyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrimidin-1-yl)ethyl)-6-fluoro-3-(3-fluorophenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one","RP-5264","RP5264","TGR-1202","UMBRALISIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FUmbralisib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Umbralisib","","2021-10-30T13:17:37.233Z")));
