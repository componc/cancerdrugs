Upon oral administration, osimertinib covalently binds to and inhibits the activity of numerous mutant forms of EGFR, including the secondarily-acquired resistance mutation T790M, L858R, and exon 19 deletions, thereby preventing EGFR-mediated signaling. This may both induce cell death and inhibit tumor growth in EGFR-overexpressing tumor cells. EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase mutated in many tumor cell types, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization. As this agent is selective towards mutant forms of EGFR, its toxicity profile may be reduced when compared to non-selective EGFR inhibitors which also inhibit wild-type EGFR.",fdaUniiCode:"3C06JJ0Z2O",identifier:"C116377",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C2167"],synonyms:["2-Propenamide, N-(2-((2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)methylamino)-4-methoxy-5-((4-(1-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-2-pyrimidinyl)amino)phenyl)-","AZD-9291","AZD9291","Mereletinib","OSIMERTINIB",a,b]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FOsimertinib",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Osimertinib","Tagrisso","","2021-10-30T13:19:07.093Z")));
