Upon administration of samrotamab vedotin, the samrotamab moiety targets and binds to LRRC15 expressed on cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and tumor cells. Upon binding and internalization, MMAE is released after proteolytic cleavage. MMAE targets and binds to tubulin, and inhibits microtubule polymerization. This results in G2\u002FM phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in LRRC15-expressing CAFs and tumor cells. LRRC15, a type I membrane protein and a member of the LRR superfamily, is highly expressed on CAFs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) within some tumor stroma and on tumor cells in certain tumors.",fdaUniiCode:"SY5HF6N5MB",identifier:"C124134",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129823","C1512"],synonyms:["ABBV-085","ADC ABBV-085","PR-1498487 PAB-MMAE","SAMROTAMAB VEDOTIN",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSamrotamab_Vedotin",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Samrotamab_Vedotin","","Samrotamab Vedotin","2021-10-30T13:30:16.933Z")));
