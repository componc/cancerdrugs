Upon administration, 5-aza-4'-thio-2'-deoxycytidine (Aza-TdC) gets incorporated into DNA, where it binds to the active site of DNMT1, a maintenance methyltransferase that contributes to the hypermethylation and silencing of tumor suppressor genes. The formation of covalent DNMT1-DNA complexes inhibits DNMT1, prevents DNA methylation of CpG sites, causes CpG demethylation, and results in the re-expression and re-activation of silenced tumor suppressor genes. This inhibits tumor cell proliferation. DNMT1, overactivated in tumor cells, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation.",fdaUniiCode:"U2PTN0RZF6",identifier:"C153479",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C1557"],synonyms:["5-AZA-4'-THIO-2'-DEOXYCYTIDINE",c,a,"5-Aza-TdCyd","Aza-TdC","Aza-TdCyd"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002F5-Aza-4-thio-2-deoxycytidine",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("5-Aza-4-thio-2-deoxycytidine","","5-Aza-4'-thio-2'-deoxycytidine","2021-10-30T13:34:05.463Z")));
