Upon administration, bemcentinib targets and binds to the intracellular catalytic kinase domain of AXL and prevents its activity. This blocks AXL-mediated signal transduction pathways and inhibits the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which, in turn, inhibits tumor cell proliferation and migration. In addition, bemcentinib enhances chemo-sensitivity. AXL, a member of the TAM (TYRO3, AXL and MER) family of receptor tyrosine kinases overexpressed by many tumor cell types, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation, survival, invasion and metastasis; its expression is associated with drug resistance and poor prognosis.",fdaUniiCode:"0ICW2LX8AS",identifier:"C121854",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C1967"],synonyms:["1H-1,2,4-Triazole-3,5-diamine, 1-(6,7-Dihydro-5H-benzo(6,7)cyclohepta(1,2-C)pyridazin-3-yl)-N3-((7S)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-7-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-5H-benzocyclohepten-2-yl)-","AXL Inhibitor BGB324","BEMCENTINIB","BGB 324","BGB-324","BGB324",a,"R-428","R428","WHO 10631"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FBemcentinib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Bemcentinib","","2021-10-30T13:29:52.953Z")));
