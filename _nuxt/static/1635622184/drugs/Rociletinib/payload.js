Rociletinib binds to and inhibits mutant forms of EGFR, including T790M, thereby leading to cell death of resistant tumor cells. Compared to other EGFR inhibitors, CO-1686 inhibits T790M, a secondary acquired resistance mutation, as well as other mutant EGFRs and may have therapeutic benefits in tumors with T790M-mediated resistance to other EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. This agent shows minimal activity against wild-type EGFR, hence does not cause certain dose-limiting toxicities.",fdaUniiCode:"72AH61702G",identifier:"C99905",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C2167"],synonyms:["CO-1686","N-(3-((2-((4-(4-Acetylpiperazin-1-yl)-2-methoxyphenyl)amino)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl)amino)phenyl)prop-2-enamide","ROCILETINIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FRociletinib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Rociletinib","","2021-10-30T13:49:07.653Z")));
