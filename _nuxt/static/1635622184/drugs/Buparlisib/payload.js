Buparlisib specifically inhibits class I PI3K in the PI3K\u002FAKT kinase (or protein kinase B) signaling pathway in an ATP-competitive manner, thereby inhibiting the production of the secondary messenger phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate and activation of the PI3K signaling pathway. This may result in inhibition of tumor cell growth and survival in susceptible tumor cell populations. Activation of the PI3K signaling pathway is frequently associated with tumorigenesis. Dysregulated PI3K signaling may contribute to tumor resistance to a variety of antineoplastic agents.",fdaUniiCode:"0ZM2Z182GD",identifier:"C90565",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C2152"],synonyms:["AN2025","BKM120","BUPARLISIB",a,"PI3K Inhibitor BKM120"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FBuparlisib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Buparlisib","","2021-10-30T13:47:10.203Z")));
