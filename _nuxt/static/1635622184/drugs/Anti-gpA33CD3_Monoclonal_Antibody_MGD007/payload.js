Anti-gpA33\u002FCD3 monoclonal antibody MGD007 possesses two antigen-recognition sites, one for the CD3 complex, a group of T-cell surface glycoproteins that complex with the T-cell receptor (TCR), and one for gpA33, a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) overexpressed on the surface of certain tumor cells. Upon administration of MGD007, this bispecific antibody simultaneously binds to both CD3-expressing T-cells and gpA33-expressing cancer cells, thereby crosslinking cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) to gpA33-expressing tumor cells. This may result in CTL-mediated cell lysis of the crosslinked tumor cells. The gpA33 antigen, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is expressed in certain malignancies, including colon and gastrointestinal cancers.",fdaUniiCode:"OZ8N9U6CEH",identifier:"C118442",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C28227"],synonyms:[c,"Humanized gpA33 x CD3 DART (TM) Protein MGD007","MGD-007","MGD007"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-gpA33CD3_Monoclonal_Antibody_MGD007",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-gpA33CD3_Monoclonal_Antibody_MGD007","Anti-gpA33\u002FCD3 Monoclonal Antibody MGD007","2021-10-30T13:19:41.973Z")));
