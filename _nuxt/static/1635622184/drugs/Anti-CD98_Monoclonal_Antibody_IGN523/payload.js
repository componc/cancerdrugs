Upon intravenous administration, IGN523 binds to CD98 expressed on the tumor cell surface and elicits both natural killer (NK)-cell mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity towards CD98-expressing tumor cells. In addition, IGN523 inhibits essential amino acid uptake by rapidly proliferating tumor cells. CD98, a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, is involved in both integrin signaling and amino acid transport processes; it is overexpressed in certain cancer cells and plays a key role in the proliferation, survival and metastasis of tumor cells.",fdaUniiCode:"7OI79TB6KN",identifier:"C113659",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:[c,"IGN-523","IGN523"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-CD98_Monoclonal_Antibody_IGN523",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-CD98_Monoclonal_Antibody_IGN523","Anti-CD98 Monoclonal Antibody IGN523","2021-10-30T13:18:40.013Z")));
