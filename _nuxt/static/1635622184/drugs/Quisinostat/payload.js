HDAC inhibitor JNJ-26481585 inhibits HDAC leading to an accumulation of highly acetylated histones, which may result in an induction of chromatin remodeling; inhibition of the transcription of tumor suppressor genes; inhibition of tumor cell division; and the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. HDAC, an enzyme upregulated in many tumor types, deacetylates chromatin histone proteins. Compared to some first generation HDAC inhibitors, JNJ-26481585 may induce superior HSP70 upregulation and bcl-2 downregulation.",fdaUniiCode:"9BJ85K1J8S",identifier:"C77912",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C1946"],synonyms:["HDAC Inhibitor JNJ-26481585","JNJ-26481585","QUISINOSTAT",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FQuisinostat",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Quisinostat","2021-10-30T13:45:02.103Z")));
