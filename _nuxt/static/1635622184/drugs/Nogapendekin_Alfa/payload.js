Upon administration, superagonist interleukin-15:interleukin-15 receptor alphaSu\u002FFc fusion complex N-803 binds to the IL-2\u002FIL-15 receptor beta-common gamma chain (IL-2Rbetagamma) receptor on natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T lymphocytes, which activates and increases the levels of NK cells and memory CD8+(CD44high) T-cells. The memory T-cells enhance the secretion of the cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-g), which further potentiates the immune response against tumor cells. This may increase tumor cell killing and decrease tumor cell proliferation. IL-15 regulates CD8+ T and NK cell development, activation and proliferation. By coupling IL-15 to IL15Ra-Fc, this agent has a prolonged drug half-life and shows an increased ability to bind IL-2Rbetagamma, which enhances its immune stimulatory activity as compared to IL-15 alone.",fdaUniiCode:"7TK323DLA0",identifier:"C107503",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129820","C129821"],synonyms:["ALT 803","ALT-803","ALT803","Fusion Protein Consisting of IL-15N72D and IL-15RaSu\u002FFC","IL-15N72D\u002FIL-15Ra-Fc","IL-15N72D:IL-15RaSu\u002FFc Fusion Complex","N 803","N-803","N803","NOGAPENDEKIN ALFA",c,"Superagonist Interleukin-15:Interleukin-15 Receptor AlphaSu\u002FFc Fusion Complex Alt-803"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FNogapendekin_Alfa",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Nogapendekin_Alfa","","Nogapendekin Alfa","2021-10-30T13:18:02.813Z")));
