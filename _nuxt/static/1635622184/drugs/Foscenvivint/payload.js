Foscenvivint specifically inhibits the recruiting of beta-catenin with its coactivator CBP (the binding protein of the cAMP response element-binding protein CREB); together with other transcription factors beta-catenin\u002FCBP binds to WRE (Wnt-responsive element) and activates transcription of a wide range of target genes of Wnt\u002Fbeta-catenin signaling. Blocking the interaction of CBP and beta-catenin by this agent prevents gene expression of many proteins necessary for growth, thereby potentially suppressing cancer cell growth. The Wnt\u002Fbeta-catenin signaling pathway regulates cell morphology, motility, and proliferation; aberrant regulation of this pathway leads to neoplastic proliferation.",fdaUniiCode:"43Y934BBZ6",identifier:"C95894",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C2189"],synonyms:["CBP\u002Fbeta-catenin Antagonist PRI-724","FOSCENVIVINT",a,"PRI-724"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FFoscenvivint",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Foscenvivint","","2021-10-30T13:48:16.063Z")));
