Upon administration, pictilisib selectively binds to PI3K in an ATP-competitive manner, inhibiting the production of the secondary messenger phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) and activation of the PI3K\u002FAkt signaling pathway. This may result in inhibition of tumor cell growth, motility and survival in susceptible tumor cell populations. Activation of the PI3K\u002FAkt signaling pathway is frequently associated with tumorigenesis; dysregulated PI3K\u002FAkt signaling may contribute to tumor resistance to a variety of antineoplastic agents.",fdaUniiCode:"ICY00EMP8P",identifier:"C165479",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C2152"],synonyms:["2-(1H-indazol-4-yl)-6-((4-(methanesulfonyl)piperazin-1-yl)methyl)-4-(morpholin-4-yl)thieno(3,2-d)pyrimidine","4-(2-(1H-indazol-4-yl)-6-((4-(methylsulfonyl)piperazin-1-yl)methyl)thieno(3,2-d)pyrimidin-4-yl)morpholine","GDC 0941","GDC-0941","GDC0941","PICTILISIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FPictilisib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Pictilisib","","2021-10-30T13:35:44.013Z")));
