Plicamycin, also known as mithramycin, binds to the minor groove of DNA at GC-rich sites, resulting in inhibition of RNA synthesis; this agent also inhibits mRNA expression, resulting in a reduction in protein synthesis. In addition, plicamycin may inhibit bone resorption by down regulating transcription of c-src, an oncogene involved in bone metabolism and resorption.",fdaUniiCode:"NIJ123W41V",identifier:"C658",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Antibiotic",subclassOf:["C2115","C67439"],synonyms:["A-2371","Aureolic acid","MTH","Mithracin","Mithracine","Mithramycin","PA-144","PLICAMYCIN",a,"mithramycin","plicamycin"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FPlicamycin",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Plicamycin","2021-10-30T13:42:46.653Z")));
