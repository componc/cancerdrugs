Upon administration, mezigdomide specifically binds to cereblon (CRBN), thereby affecting the ubiquitin E3 ligase activity, and targeting certain substrate proteins for ubiquitination. This induces proteasome-mediated degradation of certain transcription factors, some of which are transcriptional repressors in T-cells. This leads to modulation of the immune system, including activation of T-lymphocytes, and downregulation of the activity of other proteins, some of which play key roles in the proliferation of certain cancer cell types. CRBN, the substrate recognition component of the CRL4-CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, plays a key role in the ubiquitination of certain proteins.",fdaUniiCode:"LA88IH4O02",identifier:"C146660",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C574"],synonyms:["CC 92480","CC-92480","CELMoD CC-92480","Cereblon E3 Ligase Modulation Drug CC-92480","Cereblon E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Modulating Agent CC-92480","Cereblon Modulator CC-92480","MEZIGDOMIDE",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FMezigdomide",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Mezigdomide","","2021-10-30T13:32:46.143Z")));
