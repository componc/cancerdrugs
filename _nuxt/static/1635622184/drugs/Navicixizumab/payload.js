The anti-DLL4 moiety of navicixizumab specifically binds to DLL4, prevents its interaction with Notch receptors, and inhibits Notch-mediated signaling and gene transcription, which may both block tumor angiogenesis and inhibit tumor cell growth. The anti-VEGF moiety binds to VEGF and prevents the binding of VEGF to its receptor, which blocks VEGF-mediated signaling and further inhibits the growth and maintenance of tumor blood vessels. The expression of DLL4 is highly restricted to the vascular endothelium; DLL4\u002FNotch signaling is required for the development of functional tumor blood vessels. The expression of the pro-angiogenic growth factor VEGF is associated with tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation and invasion.",fdaUniiCode:"1W14T9L25W",identifier:"C119620",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C1742","C28227"],synonyms:["Immunoglobulin G2-kappa, Anti-(Homo sapiens DLL4(delta-like 4)) and Anti-(Homo sapiens VEGFA (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A,VEGF-a, VEGF)), Humanized and Chimeric Monoclonal Antibody, Bispecific","NAVICIXIZUMAB",a,"OMP 305B83","OMP-305B83","OMP305B83"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FNavicixizumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Navicixizumab","","2021-10-30T13:19:50.543Z")));
