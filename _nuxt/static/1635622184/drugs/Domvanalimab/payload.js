Upon administration, domvanalimab targets and binds to TIGIT expressed on various immune cells, particularly on tumor-infiltrating T-lymphocytes (TILs), thereby preventing the interaction of TIGIT with its ligands CD112 (nectin-2; poliovirus receptor related-2; PRR2; PVRL2) and CD155 (poliovirus receptor; PVR; nectin-like protein 5; NECL-5). This enhances the interaction of CD112 and CD155 with the costimulatory receptor CD226 (DNAX Accessory molecule-1; DNAM-1), which is expressed on immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T-cells. This leads to CD226 dimerization and CD226-mediated signaling and activates the immune system to exert a T-cell-mediated immune response against cancer cells. TIGIT, a member of the Ig super family (IgSF) and an immune inhibitory receptor, plays a key role in the suppression of T-cell proliferation and activation; it is involved in tumor cell immune evasion, and the inhibition of antiviral immune responses.",fdaUniiCode:"45X7OU8C4J",identifier:"C162875",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Immunologic Factor",subclassOf:["C129822","C134787"],synonyms:["AB 154","AB-154","AB154","Anti-TIGIT Monoclonal Antibody AB154","DOMVANALIMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FDomvanalimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Domvanalimab","","2021-10-30T13:35:29.483Z")));
