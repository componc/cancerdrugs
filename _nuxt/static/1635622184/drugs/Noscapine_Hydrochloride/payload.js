Noscapine binds to tubulin and alters its conformation, resulting in a disruption of the dynamics of microtubule assembly (by increasing the time that microtubules spend idle in a paused state) and subsequently, the inhibition of mitosis and tumor cell death. Unlike other tubulin inhibitors such as the taxanes and vinca alkaloids, noscapine does not affect microtubule polymerization.",fdaUniiCode:"TTN62ITH9I",identifier:"C61103",preferredName:b,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C221","C25974"],synonyms:["1(3H)Isobenzofuranone,6,7-dimethoxy-3-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-4-methoxy-6-methyl-1,3,-dioxolo(4,5-g)isoquinolin-5-yl)-hydrochloride","NOSCAPINE HYDROCHLORIDE","Narcotine hydrochloride","Noscapine HCl",b]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FNoscapine_Hydrochloride",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Noscapine_Hydrochloride","Noscapine Hydrochloride","2021-10-30T13:41:22.063Z")));
