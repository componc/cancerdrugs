The antibody moiety of sacituzumab govitecan selectively binds to TROP2. After internalization and proteolytic cleavage, SN-38 selectively stabilizes topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complexes, resulting in DNA breaks that inhibit DNA replication and trigger apoptosis. TROP2, also known as epithelial glycoprotein-1 (EGP-1), is a transmembrane calcium signal transducer that is overexpressed by a variety of human epithelial carcinomas; this antigen is involved in the regulation of cell-cell adhesion and its expression is associated with increased cancer growth, aggressiveness and metastasis.",fdaUniiCode:"M9BYU8XDQ6",identifier:"C102783",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129823","C1512"],synonyms:["IMMU-132","RS7-SN38","SACITUZUMAB GOVITECAN",c,"Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy","Trodelvy","hRS7-SN38 Antibody Drug Conjugate"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSacituzumab_Govitecan",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Sacituzumab_Govitecan","","Sacituzumab Govitecan","2021-10-30T13:17:13.323Z")));
