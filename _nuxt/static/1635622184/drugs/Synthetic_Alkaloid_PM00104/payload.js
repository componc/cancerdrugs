PM00104 reversibly binds to DNA, thereby inducing cytotoxicity due to its interference with DNA replication, transcription, and translation processes. DNA binding by this agent does not trigger DNA damage checkpoint responses, hence PM00104 demonstrates a manageable and reversible cytotoxicity as part of its antitumor activity.",fdaUniiCode:"C21EZR41AY",identifier:"C62763",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C2842"],synonyms:["PM-00104","PM00104",c,"Zalypsis"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSynthetic_Alkaloid_PM00104",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Synthetic_Alkaloid_PM00104","Synthetic Alkaloid PM00104","2021-10-30T13:42:16.613Z")));
