After binding to HER2 on the tumor cell surface, margetuximab may induce an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against tumor cells overexpressing HER2. HER2, a tyrosine kinase receptor, is overexpressed by many cancer cell types. Compared to other anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies, the Fc domain of MGAH22 is optimized with increased binding to the activating Fcgamma receptor IIIA (CD16A), expressed on cells such as natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages, thereby mediating an enhanced ADCC; the Fc domain also shows decreased binding to the inhibitory Fcgamma receptor IIB (CD32B).",fdaUniiCode:"K911R84KEW",identifier:"C91733",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C20401"],synonyms:["Immunoglobulin G1, Anti-(human Neu (Receptor)) (Human-Mus musculus Monoclonal MGAH22 Clone ch4D5 Heavy Chain), Disulfide with Human-Mus musculus Monoclonal MGAH22 Clone ch4D5 Light Chain, Dimer","MARGETUXIMAB","MGAH-22","MGAH22","Margenza",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FMargetuximab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Margetuximab","","2021-10-30T13:47:33.683Z")));
