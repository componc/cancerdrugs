Upon oral administration, ASP8273 covalently binds to and inhibits the activity of mutant forms of EGFR, including the T790M EGFR mutant, thereby preventing EGFR-mediated signaling. This may both induce cell death and inhibit tumor growth in EGFR-overexpressing tumor cells. EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase mutated in many tumor cell types, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization. ASP8273 preferentially inhibits mutated forms of EGFR including T790M, a secondarily acquired resistance mutation, and may have therapeutic benefits in tumors with T790M-mediated resistance when compared to other EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. As this agent is selective towards mutant forms of EGFR, its toxicity profile may be reduced as compared to non-selective EGFR inhibitors which also inhibit wild-type EGFR.",fdaUniiCode:"47DD4548PB",identifier:"C115110",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C2167"],synonyms:["2-Pyrazinecarboxamide, 6-Ethyl-3-((4-(4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-1-piperidinyl)phenyl)amino)-5-(((3R)-1-(1-oxo-2-propen-1-yl)-3-pyrrolidinyl)oxy)-","ASP8273","NAQUOTINIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FNaquotinib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Naquotinib","","2021-10-30T13:18:54.243Z")));
