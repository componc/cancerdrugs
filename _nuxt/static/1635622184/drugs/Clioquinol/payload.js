Clioquinol forms a stable chelate with copper (copper (II) ions), which inhibits the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome; consequently, ubiquitinated proteins may accumulate in tumor cells, followed by tumor cell apoptosis and the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. In addition, the clioquinol-copper complex appears to decrease the expression of androgen receptors (AR) in human copper-enriched prostate cancer cells. Serum levels of copper are often elevated in patients with cancer; copper chelation may inhibit copper-dependent endothelial cell proliferation and tumor secretion of angiogenic factors.",fdaUniiCode:"7BHQ856EJ5",identifier:"C65337",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C1742","C254"],synonyms:["5-Chloro-7-iodo-8-hydroxyquinoline","5-Chloro-7-iodo-quinolin-8-ol","AI3-16451","CLIOQUINOL",a,"Iodochlorohydroxyquinoline","Mycoquin"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FClioquinol",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Clioquinol","2021-10-30T13:42:40.823Z")));
