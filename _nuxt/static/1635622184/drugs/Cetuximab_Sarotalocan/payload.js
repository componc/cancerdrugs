Upon injection of cetuximab sarotalocan, the cetuximab moiety targets and binds to EGFR-expressing tumor cells, resulting in the internalization of the conjugate. Upon localized application of near-infrared (NIR) light, the IR700 dye becomes activated, disrupts the cell membrane and selectively kills the EGFR-expressing tumor cells.
