Upon administration, ezabenlimab selectively binds to and blocks the activation of PD-1, an immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily transmembrane protein, by its ligands programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), which is overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2), which is primarily expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This results in the activation of T-cells and T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and plays a key role in in tumor evasion from host immunity.",fdaUniiCode:"5V1UI86573",identifier:"C132252",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C128037","C129822"],synonyms:["Anti-PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody BI 754091","BI 754091","EZABENLIMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FEzabenlimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Ezabenlimab","","2021-10-30T13:31:34.263Z")));
