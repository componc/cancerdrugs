Plozalizumab binds to CCR2 and prevents binding of the endothelium-derived CLL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 or MCP1) to its receptor CCR2, which may result in inhibition of CCR2 activation and so inhibition of angiogenesis, tumor cell migration, and tumor cell proliferation. In addition, this agent may reduce levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). The G-protein coupled receptor CCR2 is expressed on the surface of monocytes and macrophages, stimulates the migration and infiltration of these cell types, and plays an important role in inflammation, angiogenesis, and tumor cell migration and proliferation.",fdaUniiCode:"4XG66BMN0D",identifier:"C88308",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C1742","C20401"],synonyms:["Immunoglobulin G1, Anti-(Human CC Chemokine Receptor CCR2) (Human-mus musculus Monoclonal 1d9 Heavy Chain), Disulfide with Human-mus musculus Monoclonal 1d9 kappa-chain, Dimer","MLN1202","PLOZALIZUMAB",a,"anti-CCR2 monoclonal antibody MLN1202"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FPlozalizumab",extension:".json",createdAt:"2021-10-30T13:46:51.883Z",updatedAt:"2021-10-30T13:46:51.893Z"}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Plozalizumab","")));
