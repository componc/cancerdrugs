Upon intravenous administration, monoclonal antibody INCAGN02385 targets and binds to human LAG-3 on tumor-infiltrating  lymphocytes (TILs) and blocks the interaction between LAG-3 and major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and tumor cells. This prevents the negative regulation of T-cell activity that occurs via LAG-3-MHC II binding and enhances a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against tumor cells, which leads to a reduction in tumor growth. LAG-3, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), negatively regulates both proliferation and activation of T-cells. Its expression on  TILs is associated with tumor-mediated immune suppression.",fdaUniiCode:"Z0A08C63DF",identifier:"C157127",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C134305"],synonyms:[c,"Anti-LAG3 Monoclonal Antibody INCAGN02385","INCAGN 02385","INCAGN 2385","INCAGN-02385","INCAGN02385","INCAGN2385"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-LAG-3_Monoclonal_Antibody_INCAGN02385",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-LAG-3_Monoclonal_Antibody_INCAGN02385","Anti-LAG-3 Monoclonal Antibody INCAGN02385","2021-10-30T13:34:35.413Z")));
