DUPIXENT can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. ( 1.1 ) as an add-on maintenance treatment of patients aged 6 years and older with moderate-to-severe asthma characterized by an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid dependent asthma. ( 1.2 ) as an add-on maintenance treatment in adult patients with inadequately controlled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP). ( 1.3 ) Limitations of Use Not for the relief of acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus.

Upon injection, dupilumab selectively binds to the IL-4R alpha chain. This disrupts IL-4\u002FIL-13 signaling and prevents the activation of downstream pathways that mediate type 2 inflammation and may potentially inhibit tumor cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis. IL-4 and IL-13 receptors are present on the surface of numerous cells involved in the pathophysiology of type-2 helper T-cell (Th2) allergic responses, including B-lymphocytes, eosinophils, dendritic cells (DCs), monocytes, macrophages, basophils, keratinocytes, bronchial epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and airway smooth muscle cells. Additionally, both IL-4 and IL-13 receptors are overexpressed in a variety of cancers and IL-4 and IL-13 and may serve as biomarkers for cancer aggressiveness. IL-4 and IL-13 are thought to be key regulatory cytokines in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and may play a role in the activation of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) that mediate tumor cell survival.",fdaUniiCode:"420K487FSG",identifier:"C162455",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C20401"],synonyms:["DUPILUMAB",a,b,"REGN 668","REGN-668","REGN668","SAR 231893","SAR-231893","SAR231893"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FDupilumab",extension:".json",createdAt:e,updatedAt:e}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Dupilumab","Dupixent","dupilumab","","2021-10-30T13:35:21.323Z")));
