Upon administration, finotonlimab targets, binds to, and inhibits PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore immune functions through the activation of T-cells and T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. PD-1, a transmembrane protein in the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) expressed on T-cells, functions as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) or 2 (PD-L2); it plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.",fdaUniiCode:"533Z4G2286",identifier:"C170758",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C128037","C129822"],synonyms:["Anti-PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody SCT-I10A","FINOTONLIMAB",a,"SCT I10A","SCT-I10A","SCTI10A"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FFinotonlimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Finotonlimab","","2021-10-30T13:36:06.083Z")));
