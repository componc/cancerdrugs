Upon administration, gilteritinib binds to and inhibits both the wild-type and mutated forms of FLT3, AXL, ALK and LTK. This may result in an inhibition of FLT3-, AXL-, ALK-, and LTK-mediated signal transduction pathways and reduced proliferation in cancer cells that overexpress these RTKs. FLT3, AXL, ALK, and LTK, which are overexpressed or mutated in a variety of cancer cell types, play key roles in tumor cell growth and survival.",fdaUniiCode:"5RZZ0Z1GJT",identifier:"C119665",preferredName:d,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C1967"],synonyms:["2-Pyrazinecarboxamide, 6-ethyl-3-((3-methoxy-4-(4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-1-piperidinyl)phenyl)amino)-5-((tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl)amino)-, (2E)-2-Butenedioate (2:1)","ASP-2215 Hemifumarate","ASP2215 Hemifumarate","GILTERITINIB FUMARATE",d,"Gilteritinib Hemifumarate",b]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FGilteritinib_Fumarate",extension:".json",createdAt:e,updatedAt:e}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Gilteritinib_Fumarate","Xospata","","Gilteritinib Fumarate","2021-10-30T13:19:51.373Z")));
