Merestinib selectively binds to c-Met, thereby inhibiting c-Met phosphorylation and disrupting c-Met signal transduction pathways. This may induce cell death in tumor cells overexpressing c-Met protein or expressing constitutively activated c-Met protein. This agent has potent anti-tumor efficacy in mono and combination therapy in a broad range of cancers. c-Met, a receptor tyrosine kinase overexpressed or mutated in many tumor cell types, plays key roles in tumor cell proliferation, survival, invasion, metastasis, and tumor angiogenesis.",fdaUniiCode:"5OGS5K699E",identifier:"C95729",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C1967"],synonyms:["3-Pyridinecarboxamide, N-(3-fluoro-4-((1-methyl-6-(1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1H-indazol-5-yl)oxy)phenyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,2-dihydro-6-methyl-2-oxo-","LY-2801653","LY2801653","MERESTINIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FMerestinib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Merestinib","","2021-10-30T13:48:07.873Z")));
