Upon oral administration, vactosertib inhibits the activity of TGFBR1 and prevents TGF-beta\u002FTGFBR1-mediated signaling. This suppresses tumor growth in TGFBR1-overexpressing tumor cells. TGFBR1, which is overexpressed in a variety of tumor cell types, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation. Expression of TGF-beta promotes tumor cell proliferation, enhances the migration of tumor cells and suppresses the response of the host immune system to tumor cells.",fdaUniiCode:"6T4O391P5Y",identifier:"C116357",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C61074"],synonyms:["TEW-7197","TEW7197","TGFBR1 Inhibitor TEW-7197","VACTOSERTIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FVactosertib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Vactosertib","","2021-10-30T13:19:06.213Z")));
