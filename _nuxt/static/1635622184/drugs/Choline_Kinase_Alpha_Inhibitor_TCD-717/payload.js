TCD-717 targets and binds to CHKA, an enzyme that plays a key role in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, the major phospholipid in eukaryotic cell membranes. Blockade of this enzyme induces cells to activate a different route for phospholipid production which causes a toxic effect and eventually leads to cell destruction. CHKA, overexpressed in human cancer cells while only minimally expressed in normal cells, appears to play a significant role in cellular proliferation, evasion of apoptosis, increased cell motility and metastasis.",fdaUniiCode:"KC1UXA6R4Z",identifier:"C94213",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C471"],synonyms:["CHKA Inhibitor TCD-717",c,"RSM-932A","TCD-717"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FCholine_Kinase_Alpha_Inhibitor_TCD-717",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Choline_Kinase_Alpha_Inhibitor_TCD-717","","Choline Kinase Alpha Inhibitor TCD-717","2021-10-30T13:47:44.493Z")));
