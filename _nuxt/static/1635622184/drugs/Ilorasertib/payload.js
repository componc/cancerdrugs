Upon administration, ilorasertib selectively binds to and inhibits Aurora kinases A, B and C, which may disrupt both the assembly of the mitotic spindle apparatus and chromosome segregation, and inhibit both cellular division and proliferation in Aurora kinase-overexpressing tumor cells. In addition, ilorasertib selectively binds to and inhibits VEGFRs and PDGFRs, which may result in the inhibition of both angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation in VEGFR\u002FPDGFR-overexpressing tumor cells. This agent also inhibits the Src family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. Aurora kinases A, B and C, are serine\u002Fthreonine kinases that play essential roles in mitotic checkpoint control and are overexpressed by a wide variety of tumor cell types. Both VEGFRs and PDGFRs are receptor tyrosine kinase families whose members may be upregulated in various tumor cell types.",fdaUniiCode:"6L5D03D975",identifier:"C116729",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C1404"],synonyms:["1-(4-(4-Amino-7-(1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)thieno[3,2-c]pyridin-3-yl)phenyl)-3-(3-fluorophenyl)urea","A-968660.0","ABT-348","ILORASERTIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FIlorasertib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Ilorasertib","","2021-10-30T13:19:14.363Z")));
