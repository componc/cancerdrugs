Upon administration, runimotamab possesses two antigen recognition sites, one for HER2, a tyrosine kinase receptor overexpressed by many cancer cell types, and one for the CD3 complex, a group of T-cell surface glycoproteins that interact with the T-cell receptor (TCR). Upon administration of runimotamab, this bispecific monoclonal antibody simultaneously binds to both CD3-expressing T-cells and HER2-expressing cancer cells, thereby crosslinking HER2-expressing tumor cells and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). This may result in potent CTL-mediated lysis of HER2-expressing tumor cells. HER2 plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization.",fdaUniiCode:"F8Z9VSZ0K1",identifier:"C156705",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C155711","C28227"],synonyms:["Anti-HER2 x Anti-CD3 Bispecific Monoclonal Antibody BTRC 4017A","Anti-HER2 x Anti-CD3 Bispecific Monoclonal Antibody RG 6194","Anti-HER2\u002FAnti-CD3 Bispecific Monoclonal Antibody 4017A","Anti-HER2\u002FAnti-CD3 Bispecific Monoclonal Antibody BTRC 4017A","BTRC 4017A","BTRC-4017A","BTRC4017A","RG 6194","RG-6194","RG6194","RUNIMOTAMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FRunimotamab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Runimotamab","","2021-10-30T13:34:25.923Z")));
