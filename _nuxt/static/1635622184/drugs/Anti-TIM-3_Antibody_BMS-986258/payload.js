Following administration, anti-TIM-3 antibody BMS-986258 binds to TIM-3 that is expressed on certain T-cells, including tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). This abrogates T-cell inhibition, activates antigen-specific T-lymphocytes and enhances cytotoxic T-cell-mediated tumor cell lysis, which together result in decreased tumor growth. TIM-3, a transmembrane protein and immune checkpoint receptor, is associated with tumor-mediated immune suppression.",fdaUniiCode:"P339Q7RL7K",identifier:"C148042",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C141146"],synonyms:[c,"Anti-TIM3 Antibody BMS-986258","BMS 986258","BMS-986258"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-TIM-3_Antibody_BMS-986258",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-TIM-3_Antibody_BMS-986258","Anti-TIM-3 Antibody BMS-986258","2021-10-30T13:33:06.673Z")));
