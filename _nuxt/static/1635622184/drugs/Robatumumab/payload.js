Anti-IGF-1R fully human monoclonal antibody SCH 717454 binds to membrane-bound IGF-1R, preventing binding of the ligand IGF-1 and the subsequent triggering of the PI3K\u002FAkt signaling pathway; downregulation of this survival pathway may result in the induction of apoptosis and decreased cellular proliferation. The activation of IGF-1R, a tyrosine kinase and a member of the insulin receptor family, stimulates cell proliferation, enables oncogenic transformation, and suppresses apoptosis; IGF-1R signaling has been highly implicated in tumorigenesis and metastasis.",fdaUniiCode:"V983921H3B",identifier:"C71527",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:["Anti-IGF-1R Recombinant Monoclonal Antibody SCH 717454","Immunoglobulin G1, Anti-(Human Insulin-Like Growth Factor I Receptor) (Human Monoclonal SCH 717454 Heavy Chain), Disulfide with Human Monoclonal SCH 717454 Light Chain, Dimer","ROBATUMUMAB",a,"Sch717454"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FRobatumumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Robatumumab","","2021-10-30T13:43:38.573Z")));
