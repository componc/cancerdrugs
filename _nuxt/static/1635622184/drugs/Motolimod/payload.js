Motolimod binds to TLR8, present in cutaneous dendritic cells, monocytes\u002Fmacrophages, and mast cells, which may result in the activation of the central transcription factor nuclear factor-B, the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and other mediators, and a Th1-weighted antitumoral cellular immune response. Primarily localized to endosomal membranes intracellularly, TLR8, like other TLRs, recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and plays a key role in the innate immune system.",fdaUniiCode:"WP6PY72ZH3",identifier:"C80521",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C177177"],synonyms:["MOTOLIMOD",a,"Toll-like Receptor 8 Agonist VTX-2337","VTX-2337","VTX-378"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FMotolimod",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Motolimod","","2021-10-30T13:45:42.073Z")));
