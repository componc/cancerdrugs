Figitumumab selectively binds to IGF1R, preventing insulin-like growth factor type 1 (IGF1) from binding to the receptor and subsequent receptor autophosphorylation. Inhibition of IGF1R autophosphorylation may result in a reduction in receptor expression on tumor cells that express IGF1R, a reduction in the anti-apoptotic effect of IGF, and inhibition of tumor growth. IGF1R is a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed on most tumor cells and is involved in mitogenesis, angiogenesis, and tumor cell survival.",fdaUniiCode:"VE267FC2UB",identifier:"C52187",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C20401"],synonyms:["CP-751,871","CP-751871","FIGITUMUMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FFigitumumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Figitumumab","","2021-10-30T13:40:33.233Z")));
