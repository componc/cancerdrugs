Upon administration, LY3415244 simultaneously targets and binds to TIM-3 expressed on certain T-cells, including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells. This blocks the interaction of TIM-3 with some of its physiologic ligands and prevents PD-L1 from binding to and activating its receptor, programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279; programmed death-1). This abrogates T-cell inhibition, activates antigen-specific T-lymphocytes and enhances cytotoxic T-cell-mediated tumor cell lysis, which may lead to a reduction in tumor growth. TIM-3, a transmembrane protein and immune checkpoint receptor, is often co-expressed with PD-1 on tumor-antigen-specific T-cells. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on activated T-cells inhibits the expansion and survival of CD8-positive T-cells, suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion.",fdaUniiCode:"603H2FWG4N",identifier:"C157058",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129822","C1454"],synonyms:[c,"LY 3415244","LY-3415244","LY3415244"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-PD-L1TIM-3_Bispecific_Antibody_LY3415244",extension:".json",createdAt:"2021-10-30T13:34:33.963Z",updatedAt:"2021-10-30T13:34:33.973Z"}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-PD-L1TIM-3_Bispecific_Antibody_LY3415244","Anti-PD-L1\u002FTIM-3 Bispecific Antibody LY3415244")));
