Citatuzumab bogatox binds to EpCAM, delivering modified bouganin cytotoxin directly to EpCam-positive tumor cells, which may result in the inhibition of tumor cell protein synthesis and tumor cell death. EpCAM, a cell surface protein, is expressed by a variety of tumor cells and is frequently found in head and neck cancers. Bouganin is a plant-derived ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP), a toxic plant N-glycosidase that depurinates the universally conserved alpha-sarcin loop of ribosomal rRNA, inactivating the ribosome and preventing protein synthesis. Compared to unmodified bouganins, modified bouganins may have a reduced propensity to activate human T cells.",fdaUniiCode:"23J303Z5CA",identifier:"C71694",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C575"],synonyms:["Anti-EpCAM Antibody Fragment-Bouganin Fusion Protein","CITATUZUMAB BOGATOX",c,"VB6-845"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FCitatuzumab_Bogatox",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Citatuzumab_Bogatox","","Citatuzumab Bogatox","2021-10-30T13:43:44.993Z")));
