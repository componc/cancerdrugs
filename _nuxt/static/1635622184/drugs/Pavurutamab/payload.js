Upon administration of pavurutamab, this bispecific antibody binds to both CD3 on cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) and BCMA found on BCMA-expressing tumor cells. This activates and redirects CTLs to BCMA-expressing tumor cells, which results in the CTL-mediated cell death of BCMA-expressing tumor cells. BCMA, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily that is specifically overexpressed on malignant plasma cells, plays a key role in promoting plasma cell survival.",fdaUniiCode:"GLR3JG8TZU",identifier:"C147028",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C181113"],synonyms:["AMG 701","AMG-701","AMG701","Anti-BCMA x Anti-CD3 BiTE AMG 701","Anti-BCMA\u002FCD3 BiTE Antibody AMG 701","BCMA\u002FCD3-directed Bispecific T-cell Engager Antibody AMG 701","BiTE Antibody AMG 701","Bispecific T-cell Engager Antibody AMG 701","PAVURUTAMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FPavurutamab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Pavurutamab","","2021-10-30T13:32:49.493Z")));
