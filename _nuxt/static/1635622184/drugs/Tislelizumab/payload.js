Upon administration, tislelizumab binds to PD-1 and inhibits the binding of PD-1 to the PD-1 ligands programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), and PD-1 ligand 2 (PD-L2). This prevents the activation of PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore immune function through the activation of both T-cells and T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. PD-1, a transmembrane protein in the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily expressed on activated T-cells, negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands; it plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.",fdaUniiCode:"0KVO411B3N",identifier:"C121775",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C128037","C129822"],synonyms:["BGB-A317","TISLELIZUMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTislelizumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Tislelizumab","","2021-10-30T13:20:18.483Z")));
