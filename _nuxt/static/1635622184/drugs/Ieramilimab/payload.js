Upon administration, Ieramilimab binds to LAG-3 expressed on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and blocks its binding with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules expressed on tumor cells. This activates antigen-specific T-lymphocytes and enhances cytotoxic T-cell-mediated tumor cell lysis, which leads to a reduction in tumor growth. LAG-3, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) and expressed on various immune cells, negatively regulates cellular proliferation and activation of T-cells. Its expression on TILs is associated with tumor-mediated immune suppression.",fdaUniiCode:"OI8P0SFD4R",identifier:"C122683",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C134305"],synonyms:["IERAMILIMAB","IMP-701",a,"LAG 525","LAG525"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FIeramilimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Ieramilimab","","2021-10-30T13:29:57.873Z")));
