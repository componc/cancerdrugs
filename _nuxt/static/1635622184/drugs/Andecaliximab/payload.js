Upon administration, andecaliximab binds to MMP-9 and inhibits its enzymatic activity. This results in an inhibition of extracellular matrix protein degradation and, potentially, the inhibition of angiogenesis, tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. MMP-9, a protein belonging to the MMP family, plays a key role in the degradation of collagens and proteoglycans; increased activity of MMP-9 has been associated with increased invasion and metastasis of cancer.",fdaUniiCode:"571045EIM4",identifier:"C105803",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:["ANDECALIXIMAB",a,"GS-5745"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAndecaliximab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Andecaliximab","","2021-10-30T13:17:48.953Z")));
