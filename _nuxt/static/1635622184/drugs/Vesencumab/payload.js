Upon intravenous administration, vesencumab specifically targets and binds to NRP1; the antibody-NRP1 complex prevents the subsequent coupling of NRP1 to VEGFR2, thereby potentially inhibiting VEGF-mediated signaling and potentially preventing angiogenesis. In combination with other anti-VEGF therapies, vesencumab may enhance their anti-angiogenic effect. NRP1 is a membrane-bound co-receptor normally expressed by endothelial cells and overexpressed by certain tumor cells, and plays a role in angiogenesis, cell survival, migration, and invasion.",fdaUniiCode:"7SF22186WT",identifier:"C91728",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C1742","C20401"],synonyms:["Immunoglobulin GL, Anti-(Human Neuropilin 1) (Human Monoclonal MNRP1685a Heavy Chain), Disulfide with Human Monoclonal MNRP1685a Light Chain, Dimer","MNRP-1685A","MNRP1685A","VESENCUMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FVesencumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Vesencumab","","2021-10-30T13:47:32.043Z")));
