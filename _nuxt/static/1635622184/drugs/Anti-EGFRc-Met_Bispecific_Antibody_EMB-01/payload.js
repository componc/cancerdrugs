Upon administration, anti-EGFR\u002Fc-Met bispecific antibody EMB-01 simultaneously targets and binds to wild-type or certain mutant forms of both EGFR and c-Met expressed on cancer cells, thereby preventing receptor phosphorylation. This prevents the activation of both EGFR- and c-Met-mediated signaling pathways and results in the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. EGFR and c-Met, both upregulated or mutated in a variety of tumor cell types, play key roles in tumor cell proliferation. In EMB-01, the two antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) are fused directly in a crisscross orientation resulting in four active and independent antigen binding sites.",fdaUniiCode:"G86X5QQ7M5",identifier:"C158085",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C1454"],synonyms:["Anti-EGFR\u002FAnti-c-Met Bispecific Antibody EMB-01",c,"Anti-cMET\u002FEGFR Bispecific Antibody EMB-01","Bispecific Antibody EMB-01","EMB 01","EMB-01","EMB01","FIT-013a"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-EGFRc-Met_Bispecific_Antibody_EMB-01",extension:".json",createdAt:"2021-10-30T13:34:44.493Z",updatedAt:"2021-10-30T13:34:44.503Z"}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-EGFRc-Met_Bispecific_Antibody_EMB-01","Anti-EGFR\u002Fc-Met Bispecific Antibody EMB-01")));
