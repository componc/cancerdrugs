Upon oral administration of cintirorgon, this agent selectively binds to the nuclear receptor transcription factor RORg, forming a receptor complex that translocates to the nucleus, and binds to ROR response elements (ROREs), enhancing the function, proliferation and survival of type 17 T-cells, including Th17 (helper T-cells) and Tc17 (cytotoxic T-cells). This may increase the expression of co-stimulatory molecules and decrease the expression of co-inhibitory molecules on T-cells leading to increased production of cytokines and chemokines by T-cells, decreased proliferation of regulatory T-cells (Tregs), and abrogation of tumor-induced immunosuppression. This ultimately induces a T-cell-mediated immune response against cancer cells and leads to a reduction in tumor cell growth. RORg, the nuclear receptor transcription factor that is involved in Th17\u002FTc17 differentiation, plays a key role in immune activation.",fdaUniiCode:"LPN433P0EA",identifier:"C131294",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129820"],synonyms:["CINTIRORGON",a,"LYC-55716","LYC55716","RORg Agonist LYC-55716"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FCintirorgon",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Cintirorgon","","2021-10-30T13:31:22.543Z")));
