Vaccination is associated with the expression of murine alpha-1,3-galactosyl (alpha-gal) carbohydrate residues on cell membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids of the vaccine pancreatic cancer cell allograft; murine alpha-gal epitopes, not present on human cells, then induce a hyperacute rejection of the vaccine pancreatic cancer cell allograft. The hyperacute rejection involves the binding of pre-existing human anti-alpha-gal antibodies (which naturally occur against gut flora) to murine alpha-gal epitopes, resulting in the rapid activation of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) towards allograft cells. The host immune system then attacks endogenous pancreatic cancer cells, resulting in ADCC towards endogenous pancreatic cancer cells.",fdaUniiCode:"I6HAD3HP89",identifier:"C61082",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129826","C1983"],synonyms:["ALGENPANTUCEL-L",a,"Alpha (1,3) Galactosyltransferase Tumor Vaccine","Alpha-1,3-Galactosyltransferase-expressing Allogeneic Pancreatic Tumor Cell Vaccine","HAPa","HyperAcute-Pancreas Immunotherapy","Hyperacute Pancreatic Cancer Vaccine"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAlgenpantucel-L",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Algenpantucel-L","","2021-10-30T13:41:18.843Z")));
