Upon administration, dubermatinib targets and binds to AXL and prevents its activity. This blocks AXL-mediated signal transduction pathways and inhibits the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which, in turn, inhibits tumor cell proliferation and migration. In addition, TP-0903 enhances chemo-sensitivity to certain other chemotherapeutic agents. AXL, a member of the Tyro3, AXL and Mer (TAM) family of receptor tyrosine kinases and overexpressed by many tumor cell types, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation, survival, invasion and metastasis; its expression is associated with drug resistance and poor prognosis.",fdaUniiCode:"14D65TV20J",identifier:"C127116",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825","C1967"],synonyms:["2-((5-Chloro-2-((4-((4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)methyl)phenyl)amino)pyrimidin-4-yl)amino)-N,N-dimethylbenzenesulfonamide","DUBERMATINIB",a,"TP 0903","TP-0903","TP0903"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FDubermatinib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Dubermatinib","","2021-10-30T13:30:55.663Z")));
