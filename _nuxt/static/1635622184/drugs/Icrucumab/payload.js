Icrucumab specifically binds to and inhibits the activity of VEGFR-1, which may prevent the activation of downstream signaling pathways and so inhibit tumor angiogenesis; the subsequent reduction in tumor nutrient supply may inhibit tumor cell proliferation. Tumor cell overexpression of VEGFR-1 may be associated with tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation and invasion; VEGFR-1 may modulate VEGFR-2 signaling.",fdaUniiCode:"T7H0B1R64U",identifier:"C79808",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C93170"],synonyms:["Anti-VEGFR-1 Monoclonal Antibody IMC-18F1","Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1 Monoclonal Antibody IMC-18F1","ICRUCUMAB","IMC-18F1","IMC18F1",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FIcrucumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Icrucumab","","2021-10-30T13:45:25.083Z")));
