Ublituximab specifically binds to the B cell-specific cell surface antigen CD20, thereby potentially inducing a B cell-directed complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against CD20-expressing B cells, leading to B cell apoptosis. CD20 is a non-glycosylated cell surface phosphoprotein that is exclusively expressed on B cells during most stages of B cell development and is often overexpressed in B-cell malignancies. Ublituximab has a specific glycosylation profile, with a low fucose content, that may enhance its ADCC response against malignant B cells.",fdaUniiCode:"U59UGK3IPC",identifier:"C91078",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C20401"],synonyms:["LFB-R603","TG-1101","TG-20","TGTX-1101","UBLITUXIMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FUblituximab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Ublituximab","","2021-10-30T13:47:18.403Z")));
