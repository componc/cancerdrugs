Upon oral administration of higher doses of elacestrant, this agent acts as a SERD, which binds to the estrogen receptor (ER) and induces a conformational change that results in the degradation of the receptor. This may inhibit the growth and survival of ER-expressing cancer cells. At lower doses of this agent, RAD1901 acts as a SERM and has estrogen-like effects in certain tissues, which can both reduce hot flashes and protect against bone loss. In addition, elacestrant is able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB).",fdaUniiCode:"FM6A2627A8",identifier:"C120211",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C1821"],synonyms:["(6R)-6-(2-(Ethyl((4-(2- (ethylamino)ethyl)phenyl)methyl)amino)-4-methoxyphenyl)- 5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol","ELACESTRANT","ER-306323",a,"RAD1901","SERD\u002FSERM RAD1901"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FElacestrant",extension:".json",createdAt:"2021-10-30T13:19:59.953Z",updatedAt:"2021-10-30T13:19:59.963Z"}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Elacestrant","")));
