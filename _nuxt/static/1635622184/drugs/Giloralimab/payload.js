Upon administration, giloralimab binds to CD40 on a variety of immune cell types. This induces CD40-dependent signaling pathways, triggers the proliferation and activation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and activates T-cells. This results in an enhanced cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against tumor cells. CD40, a cell surface receptor and member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF), is expressed on various immune cells and plays a key role in the activation of the immune system.",fdaUniiCode:"W6C58X3BFH",identifier:"C139553",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C133877"],synonyms:["ABBV-927","Agonistic Anti-CD40 Monoclonal Antibody ABBV-927","Anti-CD40 Agonist Monoclonal Antibody ABBV-927","Anti-CD40 Monoclonal Antibody ABBV-927","GILORALIMAB",a,"PR-1614645"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FGiloralimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Giloralimab","","2021-10-30T13:32:17.743Z")));
