Upon oral administration, mTORC1\u002F2 inhibitor LXI-15029 binds to the kinase domain of mTOR and inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2, in an ATP-competitive manner. This inhibits mTOR-mediated signaling and leads to both an induction of apoptosis and a decrease in the proliferation of mTORC1\u002F2-expressing tumor cells. mTOR is a serine\u002Fthreonine kinase that is upregulated in certain tumor cell types. It plays an important role in the PI3K\u002FAkt\u002FmTOR signaling pathway, which is often deregulated in cancer cells and promotes cell growth, survival, and resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.",fdaUniiCode:"RM15YYQ1CI",identifier:"C148528",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825"],synonyms:["LXI-15029","LXI15029","MTI-31","SCC-31",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FmTORC_12_Inhibitor_LXI-15029",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("mTORC_12_Inhibitor_LXI-15029","","mTORC 1\u002F2 Inhibitor LXI-15029","2021-10-30T13:33:14.343Z")));
