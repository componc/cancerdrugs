Anti-CD3 immunotoxin A-dmDT390-bisFv(UCHT1) consists of 1-390 amino acid residues of chain A diphtheria toxin (DT) joined via a spacer to the Fv fragment of UCHT1, which is connected to a second UCHT1 Fv fragment via a disulfide bond (hence the \"bisFv\" designation); the addition of the second Fv fragment overcomes the steric hindrance of immunotoxin binding due to the large N-terminal DT domain. Once inside target T cells, the DT moiety catalyzes the transfer of the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD to diphthamide, a posttranslationally modified histidine residue found in elongation factor 2 (EF-2); inactivation of EF-2, disruption of polypeptide chain elongation, and cell death ensue. CD3 is a complex of five cell-surface polypeptides associated with the T cell receptor (TCR) complex.",fdaUniiCode:"P7MQ9ZOQ82",identifier:"C74004",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C575"],synonyms:["A-dmDT390-bisFv(UCHT1)",c,"RESIMMUNE","Resimmune"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-CD3_Immunotoxin_A-dmDT390-bisFvUCHT1",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-CD3_Immunotoxin_A-dmDT390-bisFvUCHT1","Anti-CD3 Immunotoxin A-dmDT390-bisFv(UCHT1)","2021-10-30T13:44:12.153Z")));
