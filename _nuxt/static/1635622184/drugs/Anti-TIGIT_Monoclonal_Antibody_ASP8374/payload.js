Upon administration, anti-TIGIT monoclonal antibody ASP8374 targets and binds to TIGIT expressed on various immune cells, particularly on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), thereby preventing the interaction of TIGIT with its ligands CD112 (nectin-2; poliovirus receptor related-2; PRR2; PVRL2) and CD155 (poliovirus receptor; PVR; nectin-like protein 5; NECL-5). This enhances the interaction of CD112 and CD155 with the costimulatory receptor CD226 (DNAX Accessory molecule-1; DNAM-1), which is expressed on immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T-cells. This leads to CD226 dimerization and CD226-mediated signaling and activates the immune system to exert a T-cell-mediated immune response against cancer cells. TIGIT, a member of the Ig super family (IgSF) and an immune inhibitory receptor, plays a key role in the suppression of T-cell proliferation and activation; it is involved in tumor cell immune evasion, and the inhibition of antiviral immune responses.",fdaUniiCode:"TB50XV90MW",identifier:"C141421",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C134787"],synonyms:["ASP 8374","ASP-8374","ASP8374",c,"PTZ-201"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-TIGIT_Monoclonal_Antibody_ASP8374",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-TIGIT_Monoclonal_Antibody_ASP8374","Anti-TIGIT Monoclonal Antibody ASP8374","2021-10-30T13:32:24.543Z")));
