Fluvastatin competitively inhibits hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a key step in cholesterol synthesis. This agent lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels, and modulates immune responses through the suppression of MHC II (major histocompatibility complex II) on interferon gamma-stimulated antigen-presenting cells such as human vascular endothelial cells. Due to its anti-inflammatory effects mediated by alterations of lipid metabolism, fluvastatin may possess chemopreventive and therapeutic antineoplastic properties.",fdaUniiCode:"4L066368AS",identifier:"C61768",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C1655"],synonyms:["FLUVASTATIN",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FFluvastatin",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Fluvastatin","2021-10-30T13:41:46.373Z")));
