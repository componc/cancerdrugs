Upon administration, BMS-986253 directly binds to IL-8, thereby inhibiting the binding of IL-8 to its receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2. This inhibits activation of IL-8-mediated signaling transduction pathways, which decreases proliferation of susceptible tumor cells. Also, BMS-986253 effectively blocks binding of IL-8 to neutrophils and inhibits neutrophil activation and recruitment towards sites of inflammation, which reduces inflammation. IL-8, a member of the CXC chemokine family, is upregulated in a variety of cancer cell types and inflammatory diseases; it plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation, endothelial cell proliferation, and cancer stem cell (CSC) renewal.",fdaUniiCode:"N0YWS8X3S9",identifier:"C124227",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C20401"],synonyms:[c,"BMS 986253","BMS-986253","BMS986253","HUMAX-IL8","HuMax-IL-8","HuMax-IL8","MDX 018","MDX-018"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-IL-8_Monoclonal_Antibody_BMS-986253",extension:".json",createdAt:"2021-10-30T13:30:18.363Z",updatedAt:"2021-10-30T13:30:18.373Z"}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-IL-8_Monoclonal_Antibody_BMS-986253","Anti-IL-8 Monoclonal Antibody BMS-986253")));
