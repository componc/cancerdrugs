Upon administration, poly-TLR agonist polyantigenic vaccine activates a number of TLRs, which may result in macrophage and plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) stimulation; secretion of interferon alpha; production of pro-inflammatory cytokines; upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules, enhanced T and B-cell stimulatory responses; T cell proliferation, and a Th1 immune response. TLRs are transmembrane receptors that recognize structurally conserved microbial molecules such as bacterial cell-surface lipopolysaccharides (LPS), lipoproteins, lipopeptides, lipoarabinomannan and flagellin, among others; immune responses stimulated by TLR activation may result in antineoplastic effects.",fdaUniiCode:"M4PN1DW08K",identifier:"C77884",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C177174"],synonyms:["CADI-05","MYCOBACTERIUM INDICUS PRANII (HEAT KILLED)","Mycobacterium Indicus Pranii (Heat Killed)",c,"Toll-like Receptor Agonist CADI-05"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTLR_Agonist_CADI-05",extension:".json",createdAt:"2021-10-30T13:44:55.063Z",updatedAt:"2021-10-30T13:44:55.073Z"}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","TLR_Agonist_CADI-05","TLR Agonist CADI-05")));
