Abituzumab, a chimeric antibody which includes the antigen binding sites of the anti-integrin mouse antibody 17E6, binds to and inhibits the activity of alphaVbeta3 integrin (vitronectin receptor); this may result in the inhibition of endothelial cell-cell interactions, endothelial cell-matrix interactions, and integrin-mediated tumor angiogenesis and metastasis in alphavbeta3-expressing tumor cells. AlphaVbeta3 integrin, a cell adhesion and signaling receptor, is expressed on the surface of tumor vessel endothelial cells and plays a crucial role in endothelial cell adhesion and migration.",fdaUniiCode:"724QD330RD",identifier:"C82422",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C129822","C1742","C20401"],synonyms:["ABITUZUMAB",a,"EMD 525797"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAbituzumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Abituzumab","","2021-10-30T13:46:01.423Z")));
