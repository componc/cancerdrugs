Upon administration, zanubrutinib inhibits the activity of BTK and prevents the activation of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling pathway. This prevents both B-cell activation and BTK-mediated activation of downstream survival pathways, which leads to the inhibition of the growth of malignant B-cells that overexpress BTK. BTK, a member of the Src-related BTK\u002FTec family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, is overexpressed in B-cell malignancies; it plays an important role in B-lymphocyte development, activation, signaling, proliferation and survival.",fdaUniiCode:"AG9MHG098Z",identifier:"C141428",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C124801","C129825"],synonyms:["(S)-7-(1-acryloylpiperidin-4-yl)-2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydropyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-3-carboxamide","BGB-3111","BTK-InhB","Brukinsa","ZANUBRUTINIB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FZanubrutinib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Zanubrutinib","","2021-10-30T13:32:25.363Z")));
