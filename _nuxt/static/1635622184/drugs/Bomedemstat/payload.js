Upon administration, bomedemstat binds to and inhibits LSD1, a demethylase that suppresses the expression of target genes by converting the di- and mono-methylated forms of lysine at position 4 of histone H3 (H3K4) to mono- and unmethylated H3K4. LSD1 inhibition enhances H3K4 methylation and increases the expression of tumor suppressor genes. In addition, LSD1 demethylates mono- or di-methylated H3K9 which increases gene expression of tumor promoting genes; thus, inhibition of LSD1 also promotes H3K9 methylation and decreases transcription of these genes. Altogether, this may lead to an inhibition of cell growth in LSD1-overexpressing tumor cells. LSD1, an enzyme belonging to the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent amine oxidase family is overexpressed in certain tumor cells and plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression, tumor cell growth and survival.",fdaUniiCode:"Y2T4ALDEAT",identifier:"C131827",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129825"],synonyms:["BOMEDEMSTAT",a,"IMG 7289","IMG-7289","LSD-1 Inhibitor IMG-7289","Lysine-specific Demethylase 1 Inhibitor IMG-7289"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FBomedemstat",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Bomedemstat","","2021-10-30T13:31:28.873Z")));
