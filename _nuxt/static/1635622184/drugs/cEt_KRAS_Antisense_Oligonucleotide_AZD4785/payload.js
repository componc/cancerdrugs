Upon intravenous administration, cEt KRAS antisense oligonucleotide AZD4785 targets and binds, with high affinity, to a unique genetic sequence within KRAS messenger RNA (mRNA), thereby inhibiting translation of KRAS protein, including forms containing activating mutations. Inhibition of KRAS protein synthesis prevents KRAS-dependent signaling and inhibits the proliferation of KRAS-driven tumor cells. KRAS, a tumor-associated antigen (TAA), is mutated in a variety of tumor cell types. It plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and survival and is associated with tumor initiation, metastasis and poor prognosis.",fdaUniiCode:"D43WWD6RDZ",identifier:"C147521",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C1291","C129821"],synonyms:["ASO AZD4785","AZD 4785","AZD-4785","AZD4785","Generation 2.5 Drug AZD4785","IONIS-KRAS-2.5Rx","cEt KRAS ASO AZD4785",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FcEt_KRAS_Antisense_Oligonucleotide_AZD4785",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","cEt_KRAS_Antisense_Oligonucleotide_AZD4785","cEt KRAS Antisense Oligonucleotide AZD4785","2021-10-30T13:32:52.003Z")));
