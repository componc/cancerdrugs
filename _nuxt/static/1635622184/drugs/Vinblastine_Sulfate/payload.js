Frequently Responsive Malignancies Generalized Hodgkin’s disease (Stages III and IV, Ann Arbor modification of Rye staging system) Lymphocytic lymphoma (nodular and diffuse, poorly and well differentiated) Histiocytic lymphoma Mycosis fungoides (advanced stages) Advanced carcinoma of the testis Kaposi’s sarcoma Letterer-Siwe disease (histiocytosis X) II. Less Frequently Responsive Malignancies Choriocarcinoma resistant to other chemotherapeutic agents Carcinoma of the breast, unresponsive to appropriate endocrine surgery and hormonal therapy Current principles of chemotherapy for many types of cancer include the concurrent administration of several antineoplastic agents. For enhanced therapeutic effect without additive toxicity, agents with different dose-limiting clinical toxicities and different mechanisms of action are generally selected. Therefore, although vinblastine sulfate is effective as a single agent in the aforementioned indications, it is usually administered in combination with other antineoplastic drugs. Such combination therapy produces a greater percentage of response than does a single-agent regimen. These principles have been applied, for example, in the chemotherapy of Hodgkin’s disease. Hodgkin's Disease Vinblastine sulfate has been shown to be one of the most effective single agents for the treatment of Hodgkin’s disease. Advanced Hodgkin’s disease has also been successfully treated with several multiple-drug regimens that included vinblastine sulfate. Patients who had relapses after treatment with the MOPP program— mechlorethamine hydrochloride (nitrogen mustard), vincristine sulfate, prednisone and procarbazine—have likewise responded to combination-drug therapy that included vinblastine sulfate. A protocol using cyclophosphamide in place of nitrogen mustard and vinblastine sulfate instead of vincristine sulfate is an alternative therapy for previously untreated patients with advanced Hodgkin’s disease. Advanced testicular germinal-cell cancers (embryonal carcinoma, teratocarcinoma and choriocarcinoma) are sensitive to vinblastine sulfate alone, but better clinical results are achieved when vinblastine sulfate is administered concomitantly with other antineoplastic agents. The effect of bleomycin is significantly enhanced if vinblastine sulfate is administered six to eight hours prior to the administration of bleomycin; this schedule permits more cells to be arrested during metaphase, the stage of the cell cycle in which bleomycin is active.",manufacturer:"Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC",splSetId:"f073b58e-56d6-4c8d-a2ce-b37719402d77"}],id:b,nciThesaurus:{casRegistry:"143-67-9",chebiId:"CHEBI:9984",chemicalFormula:"C46H58N4O9.H2O4S",definition:"The sulfate salt of vinblastine, a natural alkaloid isolated from the plant Catharanthus roseus (Madagascar periwinkle) with antineoplastic properties.
