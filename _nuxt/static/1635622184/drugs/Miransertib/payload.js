Miransertib binds to and inhibits the activity of AKT in a non-ATP competitive manner, which may result in the inhibition of the PI3K\u002FAKT signaling pathway. This may lead to the reduction in tumor cell proliferation and the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. The AKT signaling pathway is often deregulated in cancer and is associated with tumor cell proliferation, survival and migration.",fdaUniiCode:"T1DQI1B52Y",identifier:"C99172",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C155764"],synonyms:["2-Pyridinamine, 3-(3-(4-(1-Aminocyclobutyl)phenyl)-5-phenyl-3H-imidazo(4,5-b)pyridin-2-yl)-","ARQ 092","MIRANSERTIB",a,"WHO 10490"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FMiransertib",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Miransertib","","2021-10-30T13:49:01.483Z")));
