Taurolidine, derived from the amino acid taurine, binds to and neutralizes bacterial exotoxins and endotoxins, or lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Taurolidine binding to LPS prevents bacterial adherence to host epithelial cells, thereby prevents bacterial invasion of uninfected host cells. Although the mechanism underlying its antineoplastic activity has not been fully elucidated, it may be related to this agent's anti-adherence property. In addition, taurolidine also promotes apoptosis by inducing various apoptotic factors and suppresses the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a protein that plays an important role in angiogenesis.",fdaUniiCode:"8OBZ1M4V3V",identifier:"C2639",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Antibiotic",subclassOf:["C258"],synonyms:["Bis(1,1-dioxoperhydro-1,2,4-thiadiazinyl-4)-methane","TAUROLIDINE",a,"Taurolin","taurolidine"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FTaurolidine",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Taurolidine","2021-10-30T13:37:57.113Z")));
