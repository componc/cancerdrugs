Upon administration, bintrafusp alfa binds to and neutralizes activated TGFbeta and binds to PD-L1. This prevents TGFbeta- and PD-L1-mediated signaling, and increases natural killer (NK) cell and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activities. This inhibits tumor cell proliferation in susceptible tumor cells. TGFbeta and PD-L1 are both upregulated in certain types of cancers; their overexpression is associated with increased evasion of immune surveillance and contributes to poor prognosis.",fdaUniiCode:"NW9K8C1JN3",identifier:"C124229",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129820"],synonyms:["Anti-PD-L1\u002FTGFbetaRII Fusion Protein M7824","Anti-PDL1\u002FTGFb Trap MSB0011359C","BINTRAFUSP ALFA",c,"M7824","MSB0011359C"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FBintrafusp_Alfa",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Bintrafusp_Alfa","","Bintrafusp Alfa","2021-10-30T13:30:18.833Z")));
