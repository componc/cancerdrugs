Upon administration, panobinostat selectively targets, binds to and inhibits HDAC, which induces hyperacetylation of core histone proteins. The accumulation of highly acetylated histones leads to chromatin remodeling, an altered pattern of gene expression, inhibition of tumor oncogene transcription and the selective transcription of tumor suppressor genes. This results in the inhibition of tumor cell division and the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. HDAC, upregulated in many tumor cell types, is an enzyme family that deacetylates histone proteins.",fdaUniiCode:"HN0T99OO4V",identifier:"C176044",preferredName:d,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C1946"],synonyms:["Farydak","PANOBINOSTAT LACTATE",d]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FPanobinostat_Lactate",extension:".json",createdAt:"2021-10-30T13:36:27.893Z",updatedAt:"2021-10-30T13:36:27.903Z"}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Panobinostat_Lactate","FARYDAK","","Panobinostat Lactate")));
