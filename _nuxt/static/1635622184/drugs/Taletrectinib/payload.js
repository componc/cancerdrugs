Upon oral administration, taletrectinib binds to and inhibits ROS1 and the NTRK family members. This inhibition leads to a disruption of ROS1- and NTRK-mediated signaling and eventually inhibits the growth of tumor cells that are overexpressing ROS1 and\u002For NTRKs. ROS1, overexpressed in certain cancer cells, plays a key role in cell growth and survival of cancer cells.
