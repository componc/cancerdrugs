TAS-108 binds to and inhibits estrogenic receptor alpha (ERa), mainly expressed in the mammary gland and uterus and upregulated in estrogen-dependent tumors. Blockage of ERa by TAS-108 prevents the binding and effects of estrogen and may lead to an inhibition of estrogen-dependent cancer cell proliferation. TAS-108 also is a partial agonist of the estrogenic receptor beta (ERb), expressed in many tissues including the central nervous system, urogenital tract, bone and cardiovascular system, thereby exerting a positive effect on these tissues. In addition, TAS-108 activates the co-repressor Silencing Mediator for Retinoid and Thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT), a protein that inhibits the activities of the estrogen receptors, which may contribute to the antitumor activity of TAS-108.",fdaUniiCode:"9B29N23K7E",identifier:"C61494",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C1821"],synonyms:["(7)-21-[4-[(diethylamino)methyl]-2-methoxyphenoxy]-7-methyl-19-norpregna-1,3,5(10)-trien-3-ol 2-hydroxy-1,2,3-propanetricarboxylate","SR 16234","SR16234",c,"TAS-108"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FSelective_Estrogen_Receptor_Modulator_TAS-108",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Selective_Estrogen_Receptor_Modulator_TAS-108","","Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator TAS-108","2021-10-30T13:41:32.043Z")));
