Upon oral administration, milademetan binds to, and prevents the binding of MDM2 protein to the transcriptional activation domain of the tumor suppressor protein p53. By preventing this MDM2-p53 interaction, the proteasome-mediated enzymatic degradation of p53 is inhibited and the transcriptional activity of p53 is restored. This results in the restoration of p53 signaling and leads to the p53-mediated induction of tumor cell apoptosis. MDM2, a zinc finger protein and a negative regulator of the p53 pathway, is overexpressed in cancer cells; it has been implicated in cancer cell proliferation and survival.",fdaUniiCode:"6M27443B0N",identifier:"C107384",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C162996"],synonyms:["DS-3032 Tosylate","DS-3032b","DS-3032b Tosylate","MILADEMETAN TOSYLATE",c]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FMilademetan_Tosylate",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Milademetan_Tosylate","Milademetan Tosylate","2021-10-30T13:18:01.773Z")));
