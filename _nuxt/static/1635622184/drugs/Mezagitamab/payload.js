Mezagitamab specifically binds to CD38 that is expressed on human plasmablasts, plasma cells, NK cells and activated T- and B-cells. This may trigger antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), cell lysis and depletion of CD38-expressing cells. Additionally, TAK-079 does not induce CD38-dependent signaling and does not promote cytokine activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs). CD38, a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, is overexpressed on cells associated with autoimmune diseases and hematologic malignancies.",fdaUniiCode:"0XMR8L9LOL",identifier:"C148078",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Pharmacologic Substance",subclassOf:["C129822","C155321"],synonyms:["Anti-CD38 MAb TAK-079","MEZAGITAMAB",a,"TAK 079","TAK-079","TAK079"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FMezagitamab",extension:".json",createdAt:"2021-10-30T13:33:07.643Z",updatedAt:"2021-10-30T13:33:07.653Z"}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Mezagitamab","")));
