Depatuxizumab targets the EGFR deletion variant, de2-7 EGFR as well as wild-type EGFR expressed in cells overexpressing the receptor, thereby preventing the activation and subsequent dimerization of the receptor; the decrease in receptor activation and dimerization result in an inhibition in signal transduction and anti-proliferative effects. This MoAb targets cells expressing aberrant EGFR, hence making it an ideal candidate for generation of radioisotope or toxin conjugates.",fdaUniiCode:"W984C353CG",identifier:"C95206",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C20401"],synonyms:["ABT-806","DEPATUXIZUMAB",a,"Immunoglobulin G1, Anti-(Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) (Human-mus musculus Monoclonal ABT-806 Heavy Chain), Disulfide with Human-mus musculus Monoclonal ABT-806 Light Chain, Dimer","anti-EGFR MoAb ABT-806","anti-EGFR mAb ABT-806","mAb-806"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FDepatuxizumab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Depatuxizumab","","2021-10-30T13:47:54.013Z")));
