Masoprocol directly inhibits activation of two receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), the insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) and the c-erbB2\u002FHER2\u002Fneu receptor, resulting in decreased proliferation of susceptible tumor cell populations. This agent may induce apoptosis in susceptible tumor cell populations as a result of disruption of the actin cytoskeleton in association with the activation of stress activated protein kinases (SAPKs). In addition, masoprocol inhibits arachidonic acid 5-lipoxygenase (5LOX), resulting in diminished synthesis of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. It may prevent leukocyte infiltration into tissues and the release of reactive oxygen species.",fdaUniiCode:"7BO8G1BYQU",identifier:"C701",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Organic Chemical",subclassOf:["C1322","C275"],synonyms:["4,4'-(2,3-Dimethyl-1,4-butanediyl)bis[1,2-benzenediol]","Actinex","MASOPROCOL",a,"NDGA","NDHGA","Nordihydroguaiaretic Acid","Nordihydroguaiaretic acid","masoprocol"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FMasoprocol",extension:".json",createdAt:b,updatedAt:b}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Masoprocol","2021-10-30T13:43:27.153Z")));
