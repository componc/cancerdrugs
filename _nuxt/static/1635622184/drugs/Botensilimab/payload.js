Upon administration, anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody  botensilimab binds to CTLA-4 expressed on T-cells and inhibits the CTLA-4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation. This leads to a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against cancer cells. CTLA-4, an inhibitory receptor and member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, plays a key role in the downregulation of the immune system. The engineered Fc domain increases the stability and half-life of the antibody.",fdaUniiCode:"1Z5YC3ME5N",identifier:"C158557",preferredName:a,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C128036","C129822"],synonyms:["AGEN 1181","AGEN-1181","AGEN1181","Anti-CTLA-4 Monoclonal Antibody AGEN1181","BOTENSILIMAB",a]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FBotensilimab",extension:".json",createdAt:c,updatedAt:c}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("Botensilimab","","2021-10-30T13:34:49.233Z")));
