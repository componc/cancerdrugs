Upon administration, anti-CD137 agonistic monoclonal antibody ADG106 binds to and activates CD137 expressed on a variety of leukocyte subsets including activated T-lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. This enhances CD137-mediated signaling, induces cytokine production and promotes T-cell mediated anti-tumor immune responses. CD137, a surface glycoprotein of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, is an inducible costimulatory receptor that plays a key role in T-cell proliferation, survival and cytolytic activity.",fdaUniiCode:"I4QM8E7Y2R",identifier:"C160715",preferredName:c,semanticType:"Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein",subclassOf:["C155745"],synonyms:["4-1BB-directed Agonistic Monoclonal Antibody ADG106","ADG 106","ADG-106","ADG106","Anti-4-1BB Agonistic Monoclonal Antibody ADG106",c,"CD137-directed Agonistic Monoclonal Antibody ADG106"]},dir:"\u002Fdrugs",path:"\u002Fdrugs\u002FAnti-CD137_Agonistic_Monoclonal_Antibody_ADG106",extension:".json",createdAt:d,updatedAt:d}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("","Anti-CD137_Agonistic_Monoclonal_Antibody_ADG106","Anti-CD137 Agonistic Monoclonal Antibody ADG106","2021-10-30T13:35:11.653Z")));
